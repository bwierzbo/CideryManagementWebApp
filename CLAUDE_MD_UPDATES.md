## Updates to `/CLAUDE.md` (Project Documentation)

### âœ… Changes Made

**1. Core Domain Entities** (Lines 45-58)
- Added `**CarbonationOperation**` to production flow

  - CarbonationOperation - Forced carbonation tracking
  - NextAuth Integration - Complete auth system
  - Session Management - Idle timeout & indicators

**2. Architecture Patterns** (Lines 70-84)
- Added new "Authentication & Authorization (NextAuth)" section
- Documented complete auth system:
  - NextAuth with credentials provider
  - JWT sessions
  - Middleware protection
  - tRPC procedures (protectedProcedure, adminProcedure, auditedProcedure)
  - RBAC system
  - 30-minute idle timeout
  - Session indicators
- Listed all auth-related file locations

**3. Frontend Section** (Lines 108-118)
- Updated "Auth.js" â†’ "NextAuth"
- Added "Domain-Specific Features" subsection:
  - CO2 Calculations (Henry's Law)
  - ABV Calculations
  - Yield Tracking
  - COGS Reporting

**4. Environment Variables** (Lines 120-131)
- Updated to mention Neon for DATABASE_URL
- Changed NEXTAUTH_URL default from 3000 â†’ 3001
- Added "Important Notes for Claude" section:
  - App runs on port 3001
  - User manages migrations manually
  - Database uses `public` schema
  - Note about neon_auth cleanup (Oct 2025)

## Updates to `/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Agent Behavior)

### âœ… Changes Made

**1. Project-Specific Patterns** (Lines 67-86)
- Added new section documenting completed work

**Authentication Patterns** (Lines 69-75)
- NextAuth configuration complete
- Middleware route protection
- Server-side utilities (`requireAuth()`, `requireAdmin()`)
- Client-side hooks (`useUser()`, `useIsAdmin()`)
- tRPC protected procedures
- IdleTimeoutProvider for session management

**Database Schema Patterns** (Lines 77-81)
- Core entities location (`/packages/db/src/schema.ts`)
- Specialized schemas location (`/packages/db/src/schema/`)
- Import pattern: Use `../schema` for core entities
- Migration numbering convention

**Domain Calculations** (Lines 83-86)
- CO2/Carbonation calculations location
- ABV calculations
- Volume tracking through production

---

## What This Means for Future Claude Sessions

### Authentication
- Claude will know NextAuth is already configured
- Won't try to recreate auth systems
- Will use existing utilities and patterns
- Understands the complete auth flow

### Database
- Claude knows the schema organization
- Won't create wrong import paths (like we just fixed in carbonation.ts)
- Understands migration patterns
- Knows about the neon_auth cleanup

### Domain Logic
- Claude knows where carbonation calculations live
- Understands the production flow including carbonation
- Can reference existing calculation utilities

### Development Workflow
- Claude knows user manages migrations
- Understands port 3001 is standard
- Won't worry about port conflicts
- Follows project-specific patterns

## Verification

To verify the updates worked, check:

```bash
# Check file modification times
stat -f "%Sm" -t "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" /Users/benjaminwierzbanowski/Code/CideryManagementApp/CLAUDE.md
stat -f "%Sm" -t "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" /Users/benjaminwierzbanowski/Code/CideryManagementApp/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Both should show: 2025-10-16 [time]
```

## Next Steps

Future Claude sessions will now:
1. âœ… Know about the NextAuth system
2. âœ… Use existing auth utilities
3. âœ… Follow database import patterns
4. âœ… Reference domain calculations correctly
5. âœ… Understand the development workflow

**No further action needed** - Documentation is up to date! ðŸŽ‰
