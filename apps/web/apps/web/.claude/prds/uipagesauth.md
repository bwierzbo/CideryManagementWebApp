# PRD: UI Pages with Authentication & Authorization

## Executive Summary

Complete the cidery management application by implementing comprehensive UI pages for Inventory Management, Advanced Reports, and Recipes Management with full authentication and authorization integration. This feature will provide complete functional coverage of the system with role-based access control, ensuring all users can efficiently manage their cidery operations through a polished, secure interface.

## Problem Statement

The current cidery management application has several gaps that prevent it from being a complete replacement for Excel-based workflows:

1. **Incomplete UI Coverage**: Key functional areas like detailed inventory management, advanced reporting, and recipes are missing dedicated UI pages
2. **Inconsistent Authentication**: While basic auth exists, not all pages properly implement role-based access control or handle authentication states gracefully
3. **Limited User Experience**: Missing polish features like proper loading states, error handling, and user feedback across pages
4. **Operational Gaps**: Users cannot fully manage inventory transactions, generate comprehensive reports, or manage recipes through the current UI

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Cidery Operator (Primary User)**

- Daily user managing production, inventory, and basic reporting
- Needs quick access to common operations
- Requires mobile-friendly interfaces for cellar work

**Cidery Owner/Admin (Secondary User)**

- Strategic oversight of operations and detailed reporting
- Manages user access and system configuration
- Needs comprehensive financial and operational reports

**Viewer/Auditor (Tertiary User)**

- Read-only access for compliance, auditing, or stakeholder reporting
- Needs filtered views based on permissions

### User Journeys

**Inventory Management Journey**

```
As a cidery operator, I want to:
1. View real-time inventory across all locations (cellar, packaging, finished goods)
2. Record inventory transactions (transfers, adjustments, losses)
3. Track inventory movements with full audit trails
4. Generate inventory reports by location, product, or date range
5. Receive alerts for low stock or expiring inventory
```

**Advanced Reporting Journey**

```
As a cidery owner, I want to:
1. Access comprehensive COGS reports with drill-down capability
2. Generate production efficiency reports (yield analysis, waste tracking)
3. Create vendor performance reports (cost, quality, delivery)
4. Export reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel)
5. Schedule automated report generation and delivery
```

**Recipe Management Journey**

```
As a cidery operator, I want to:
1. Create and manage cider recipes with ingredient specifications
2. Scale recipes based on batch sizes
3. Track recipe performance and costs
4. Version control recipe modifications
5. Generate shopping lists from recipes
```

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics

- **Feature Completion**: 100% of identified UI pages implemented with full functionality
- **Authentication Coverage**: 100% of pages properly implement role-based access control
- **User Adoption**: 90% of target workflows can be completed without reverting to Excel
- **Performance**: All pages meet performance requirements (load times, response times)

### Secondary Metrics

- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from beta users on usability and completeness
- **Error Rate**: Less than 1% of user actions result in unhandled errors
- **Mobile Usage**: 30% of users can successfully complete key tasks on mobile devices
- **Security**: Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication/authorization implementation

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

- Must work within existing Next.js 15 + tRPC + PostgreSQL architecture
- Must maintain compatibility with existing data models and API endpoints
- Must use existing shadcn/ui component library for consistency
- Must support existing user roles without modification

### Timeline Constraints

- Target completion within 3-4 weeks
- Must not disrupt existing functionality during development
- Phased rollout preferred (inventory → reports → recipes)

### Resource Constraints

- Single developer implementation
- No additional third-party services or significant infrastructure changes
- Must leverage existing audit logging and RBAC systems

### Assumptions

- Current authentication system is sufficient for expanded functionality
- Existing database schema supports inventory transaction tracking
- Users are familiar with current application navigation patterns
- Mobile usage will grow significantly with improved mobile experience

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building

- **Advanced Analytics/BI**: Complex data science or machine learning features
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple cideries in single instance
- **E-commerce Integration**: Direct sales or customer-facing features
- **Mobile Native Apps**: Web-only solution, no iOS/Android native apps
- **Third-party Integrations**: QuickBooks, external inventory systems, etc.
- **Workflow Automation**: Advanced business process automation or notifications
- **API for External Access**: Public API for third-party integrations

### Future Considerations

- Integration with accounting systems
- Advanced inventory forecasting
- Customer relationship management features
- Supply chain optimization tools

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- Continued stability of Next.js 15 and tRPC frameworks
- PostgreSQL database availability and performance
- Third-party UI component library (shadcn/ui) updates

### Internal Dependencies

- Completion of current authentication system debugging (in progress)
- Database schema may need minor additions for inventory transactions
- Existing RBAC system must be fully functional
- Current audit logging system for tracking user actions

### Team Dependencies

- Product feedback from actual cidery operators for usability validation
- Testing support for various user roles and scenarios
- Deployment pipeline readiness for new pages and features

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Inventory Management (Week 1-2)

Priority implementation order based on user value and technical complexity.

### Phase 2: Advanced Reports (Week 2-3)

Builds on existing COGS foundation, adds visualization and export capabilities.

### Phase 3: Recipe Management (Week 3-4)

New functionality area, requires new data models and workflows.

### Risk Mitigation

- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout development
- Create comprehensive test coverage for authentication flows
- Plan for database migration rollback if needed
