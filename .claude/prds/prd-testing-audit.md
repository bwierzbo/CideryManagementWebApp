# PRD: Testing & Audit Guarantees

## Vision / Problem

Developers and admins must trust that every cidery workflow enforces business rules and leaves a complete audit trail. Without this, operators risk mis-recorded volumes, negative inventory, or compliance failures.

**Value Proposition**: Zero-defect production operations with complete operational transparency and regulatory compliance through automated testing and audit trails.

## Users / Stakeholders

- **Developers**: need regression safety and fast feedback
- **Admins**: need regulatory compliance and traceability
- **Operators**: protected from mistakes by guardrails

## Core Focus

Comprehensive testing framework and audit system ensuring bulletproof business rule enforcement and complete change tracking.

## Key Components

- **Unit Tests**: ABV, yield, variance, and COGS calculations
- **Integration Tests**: Transfers, packaging, and inventory flows
- **Business Rule Guards**: Negative/over-capacity protection with clear error messages
- **Audit Logging**: 100% mutation coverage with diff snapshots for every change
- **Coverage Requirements**: ≥95% code coverage; `pnpm test -w` must pass in CI


## Success Criteria

- Zero critical business rules can be bypassed
- Complete audit trails for regulatory compliance
- Automated validation that all mutations trigger audit logs
- Robust testing foundation that supports confident feature development


## Out of Scope

- Load/performance testing
- External compliance report integrations

## Dependencies

- Schema and routers from Prompts 3 & 7 must exist
- Seed/demo data (Prompt 11) for integration test fixtures

## Acceptance / Deliverables

- Vitest suite under `/tests` with ≥95% coverage
- CI workflow fails if coverage drops
- Audit log diffs captured in test snapshots
