# PRD: Codebase & Database Cleanup (Safe Refactor, No Feature Changes)

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a comprehensive cleanup initiative for the CideryManagementApp monorepo, focusing on removing duplicate/unused code, standardizing linting/formatting, cleaning unused database elements, and establishing repeatable cleanup workflows. The initiative maintains strict guardrails ensuring zero functional changes while improving code quality, reducing technical debt, and optimizing build performance.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

The CideryManagementApp codebase has accumulated technical debt through rapid development:
- **Unused code and dependencies** increasing bundle size and complexity
- **Duplicate files and assets** creating maintenance confusion
- **Database schema drift** with unused tables/columns consuming resources
- **Inconsistent code formatting** making reviews difficult
- **No systematic cleanup process** allowing debt to accumulate unchecked

### Why is this important now?

- **Performance Impact**: Unused code and dependencies slow builds and increase bundle sizes
- **Maintenance Burden**: Developers waste time navigating dead code and duplicates
- **Database Costs**: Unused tables/columns consume storage and backup resources
- **Team Velocity**: Inconsistent formatting and linting creates review friction
- **Risk Management**: Lack of cleanup processes allows debt to compound
