# PRD: Recent Purchase PDF Report

## Executive Summary

The Recent Purchase PDF Report feature enables cidery operators, managers, and accounting teams to generate professional PDF reports for both individual purchase orders and aggregated purchase activities across configurable time periods. This dual-purpose feature addresses critical needs for vendor communication (single purchase order reports sent to orchards) and internal business operations (comprehensive date range reports for analysis and reconciliation). The feature provides formatted reports suitable for external vendor sharing, internal documentation, and business decision-making.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **Manual Vendor Communication**: Staff manually create purchase confirmations and receipts to send to orchards/vendors
- **Inconsistent Purchase Documentation**: No standardized format for individual purchase order confirmations sent to vendors
- **Limited Export Options**: No automated way to generate professional reports for vendors, accountants, or regulatory compliance
- **Time-Intensive Analysis**: Vendor performance and purchase trend analysis requires manual data extraction and formatting
- **Dual Documentation Burden**: Separate manual processes for vendor communication and internal reporting

### Business Impact
- **Vendor Relationship Strain**: Delayed or inconsistent purchase confirmations damage orchard relationships
- **Operational Inefficiency**: 3-4 hours weekly spent on vendor communications and internal purchase summaries
- **Compliance Risk**: Lack of standardized purchase documentation for audit requirements and vendor agreements
- **Professional Image**: Unprofessional vendor communications impact cidery's business reputation
- **Financial Planning**: Limited ability to quickly analyze purchase patterns for budgeting and forecasting
