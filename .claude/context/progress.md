### UI Pages Authentication Epic (IN PROGRESS)
- âœ… PRD created for authentication and core pages
- âœ… Epic decomposed into 6 GitHub issues (#16-21)
- âœ… GitHub issues synced and ready for implementation
- ðŸ”„ Authentication pages implementation pending
- ðŸ”„ Inventory management pages pending
- ðŸ”„ Reports interface pending
- ðŸ”„ Recipes management pending

### Build System Stabilization (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Fixed all Vercel TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… Resolved drizzle-orm dependency compatibility issues

- âœ… Context documentation system established

## Current Challenges

### Development & Testing
- ðŸ”„ **Form Validation**: Recently resolved controlled/uncontrolled input issues in FruitLoadFormWithTRPC
- ðŸ”„ **RBAC Permissions**: Recently added purchaseLine entity to RBAC system to resolve permissions errors
- ðŸ”„ **UI Simplification**: Quality measurement fields removed from load form per user requirements
- ðŸ”„ **Component Integration**: Press run workflow now fully functional with simplified weight-only input

### Recent Commits (Last 5)
- `444c29e` - Fix ApplePress frontend components and add missing dependencies
- `c5eb9de` - Task #27: Implement comprehensive offline capability & resume functionality
- `ed7a006` - Task #26: Implement press run completion UI with mobile-first design
- `ab7b4f5` - Task #23: Purchase Line Integration for Apple Press workflow
- `f708bee` - Task #30: Implement ApplePress database migration

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1 - Apple Press Testing & Refinement
1. **User Testing & Feedback**
   - Test complete press run workflow end-to-end
   - Validate RBAC permissions are working correctly
   - Ensure simplified weight-only form meets requirements

2. **Code Quality & Documentation**
   - Commit current Apple Press implementation
   - Update documentation to reflect new functionality
   - Clean up any remaining TypeScript errors

### Priority 2 - Core Features (Post-Deployment)
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement Auth.js with credentials provider
   - Set up role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
   - Create user management interface

2. **Database Setup**
   - Complete Drizzle schema definitions for all entities
   - Generate and run initial migrations
   - Create seed data for development

3. **Vendor Management**
   - Create vendor CRUD operations
   - Implement vendor selection interface

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- **Vercel Deployment**: Module resolution issues preventing successful cloud builds
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL database setup required for production
- **Environment Configuration**: Production environment variables needed

### Technical Progress
- âœ… Comprehensive test framework established (Playwright E2E, Vitest unit tests)
- âœ… Database schema architecture designed (audit system, RBAC)
- âœ… API structure planned with tRPC
- ðŸ”„ Frontend component implementation started

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] All packages building successfully
- [ ] Database schema complete and migrated
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] First CRUD operations functional

### Medium Term (1 month)
- [ ] Core production workflow implemented
- [ ] COGS reporting functionality
- [ ] Role-based access working
- [ ] Data validation and error handling

### Long Term (3 months)
- [ ] Complete cidery production tracking
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- [ ] Audit logging throughout system
- [ ] Performance optimization complete

## Notes

- Project follows strict development rules (no partial implementations, comprehensive testing)
- Heavy emphasis on autofill and smart defaults for UX
- Single facility focus with scalable architecture
- Cloud-hosted with no offline mode requirements
