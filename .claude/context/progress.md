# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Build System Stabilization & Deployment Setup
**Branch**: main
**Last Commit**: 35a51e8 - Fix db package module resolution - ensure Database type export

## Recent Work Completed

### Infrastructure Setup (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Monorepo structure established with pnpm workspaces
- âœ… TypeScript configuration with shared base config
- âœ… Next.js 15 web application scaffolded
- âœ… tRPC API package structure created
- âœ… Drizzle ORM database package initialized
- âœ… Shared library package for domain logic
- âœ… Background worker package for jobs
- âœ… Development tooling configured (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)

### System Verification Framework (COMPLETED)
- âœ… E2E testing infrastructure with Playwright
- âœ… Health check endpoints across all services
- âœ… Page verification system for route testing
- âœ… Quality dashboard with coverage metrics
- âœ… Performance monitoring framework
- âœ… Coverage trend tracking

### UI Pages Authentication Epic (IN PROGRESS)
- âœ… PRD created for authentication and core pages
- âœ… Epic decomposed into 6 GitHub issues (#16-21)
- âœ… GitHub issues synced and ready for implementation
- ðŸ”„ Authentication pages implementation pending
- ðŸ”„ Inventory management pages pending
- ðŸ”„ Reports interface pending
- ðŸ”„ Recipes management pending

### Build System Stabilization (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Fixed all Vercel TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… Resolved drizzle-orm dependency compatibility issues
- âœ… Fixed module resolution in db package exports
- âœ… Updated pnpm lockfile for dependency consistency
- âœ… Established proper Vercel build configuration

### Documentation
- âœ… Comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- âœ… CLAUDE.md project guidance created
- âœ… Development scripts and commands documented
- âœ… Context documentation system established

## Current Challenges

### Vercel Deployment Issues
- ðŸ”„ **Module Resolution**: Still encountering db package import issues on Vercel despite local fixes
- ðŸ”„ **Build Configuration**: Root directory set to `apps/web` but build commands need monorepo context
- ðŸ”„ **Node.js Version**: Using Node.js 20.x as specified in engines
- ðŸ”„ **Dependency Management**: pnpm workspace linking in cloud environment

### Recent Commits (Last 5)
- `35a51e8` - Fix db package module resolution - ensure Database type export
- `c5535b0` - Update pnpm lockfile after adding drizzle-orm to lib package
- `7389849` - Fix remaining TypeScript build errors
- `fc99fb6` - Fix db package module resolution for Vercel
- `17b14de` - Fix drizzle-orm count function compatibility

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1 - Deployment Stabilization
1. **Resolve Vercel Build Issues**
   - Fix persistent module resolution for db package
   - Ensure monorepo build works in cloud environment
   - Validate all TypeScript compilation passes

2. **UI Pages Auth Epic Implementation**
   - Start with Issue #16: Authentication pages
   - Implement login/register/profile pages
   - Set up Auth.js integration

### Priority 2 - Core Features (Post-Deployment)
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement Auth.js with credentials provider
   - Set up role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
   - Create user management interface

2. **Database Setup**
   - Complete Drizzle schema definitions for all entities
   - Generate and run initial migrations
   - Create seed data for development

3. **Vendor Management**
   - Create vendor CRUD operations
   - Implement vendor selection interface

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- **Vercel Deployment**: Module resolution issues preventing successful cloud builds
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL database setup required for production
- **Environment Configuration**: Production environment variables needed

### Technical Progress
- âœ… Comprehensive test framework established (Playwright E2E, Vitest unit tests)
- âœ… Database schema architecture designed (audit system, RBAC)
- âœ… API structure planned with tRPC
- ðŸ”„ Frontend component implementation started

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] All packages building successfully
- [ ] Database schema complete and migrated
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] First CRUD operations functional

### Medium Term (1 month)
- [ ] Core production workflow implemented
- [ ] COGS reporting functionality
- [ ] Role-based access working
- [ ] Data validation and error handling

### Long Term (3 months)
- [ ] Complete cidery production tracking
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- [ ] Audit logging throughout system
- [ ] Performance optimization complete

## Notes

- Project follows strict development rules (no partial implementations, comprehensive testing)
- Heavy emphasis on autofill and smart defaults for UX
- Single facility focus with scalable architecture
- Cloud-hosted with no offline mode requirements

## Update History

- 2025-09-13T19:24:59Z: Updated to reflect build system stabilization work, Vercel deployment challenges, UI Pages Auth epic progress, and current development focus on deployment issues
