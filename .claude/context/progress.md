## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1 - Core Setup
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up `.env.local` with required environment variables
   - Configure database connection (PostgreSQL)
   - Set up Auth.js authentication

2. **Database Schema**
   - Complete Drizzle schema definitions for all entities
   - Generate and run initial migrations
   - Create seed data for development

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement Auth.js with credentials provider
   - Set up role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
   - Create user management interface

### Priority 2 - Core Features
1. **Vendor Management**
   - Create vendor CRUD operations
   - Implement vendor selection interface

2. **Purchase Tracking**
   - Build purchase recording system
   - Implement purchase line items
   - Add vendor integration

3. **Production Workflow**
   - Press run tracking
   - Juice lot management
   - Fermentation batch monitoring

## Blockers & Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database setup required
- Environment variable configuration needed
- Authentication provider configuration

### Technical Debt
- No tests implemented yet (required by project rules)
- Database migrations not generated
- API endpoints not implemented
- Frontend components not built

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] All packages building successfully
- [ ] Database schema complete and migrated
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] First CRUD operations functional

### Medium Term (1 month)
- [ ] Core production workflow implemented
- [ ] COGS reporting functionality
- [ ] Role-based access working
- [ ] Data validation and error handling

### Long Term (3 months)
- [ ] Complete cidery production tracking
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- [ ] Audit logging throughout system
- [ ] Performance optimization complete

## Notes

- Project follows strict development rules (no partial implementations, comprehensive testing)
- Heavy emphasis on autofill and smart defaults for UX
- Single facility focus with scalable architecture
- Cloud-hosted with no offline mode requirements
