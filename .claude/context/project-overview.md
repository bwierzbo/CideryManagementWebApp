# Project Overview

## Application Summary

**Cidery Management MVP** is a comprehensive web application designed to replace Excel-based production tracking for small to medium-sized cideries. The system provides end-to-end management of the cidery production workflow from raw material procurement through finished goods inventory.

## Feature Catalog

### Production Management

- **Purchase Tracking**: Detailed purchase orders with line items, costs, and delivery tracking
- **Press Run Operations**: Apple pressing session management with yield calculations
- **Juice Lot Management**: Batch tracking of pressed juice with quality specifications
- **Vessel Management**: Fermentation container tracking with capacity and status monitoring
- **Batch Fermentation**: Complete fermentation lifecycle management with timeline tracking
- **Quality Measurements**: ABV, pH, specific gravity, and custom quality metric recording
- **Transfer Operations**: Liquid movement tracking between vessels and production stages
- **Blending Operations**: Multi-batch blend recipe creation and execution
- **Packaging Runs**: Bottling and canning operations with finished goods creation

### Inventory & Financial Management
- **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time finished goods inventory with movement history
- **Cost Allocation**: Detailed cost tracking from raw materials through finished products
- **COGS Calculation**: Precise cost-of-goods-sold analysis per batch and product
- **Yield Analysis**: Production yield tracking at each stage of the process
- **Report Generation**: Automated CSV and PDF report creation for business analysis

### System Management
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with NextAuth.js credentials provider
- **Role-Based Access**: Three-tier permission system (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
- **Audit Logging**: Complete change history for all system operations
- **Reference Data**: Configurable units, categories, and system parameters
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling

## Current State Assessment
