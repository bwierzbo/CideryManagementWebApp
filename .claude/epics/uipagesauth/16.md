# Task: Authentication & Route Protection

## Description
Implement foundational authentication system using NextAuth with credential provider, role-based access control, and route protection middleware for Next.js 15 App Router. This establishes the security foundation for all UI pages and API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NextAuth configured with credential provider and database session storage
- [ ] Role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Viewer) integrated with session
- [ ] Route protection middleware working with App Router for protected pages
- [ ] Login/logout functionality with proper session management
- [ ] User authentication state properly managed across the application

## Technical Details
Implementation approach:
- Configure NextAuth with PostgreSQL adapter for session persistence
- Create credential provider with bcrypt password hashing
- Implement middleware for route protection using Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Add role checking utilities for component-level access control
- Set up proper TypeScript types for session and user objects

Key files affected:
- `apps/web/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth configuration
- `apps/web/middleware.ts` - Route protection middleware
- `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` - Auth utilities and configuration
- `packages/db/schema/users.ts` - User and session schema extensions
- `apps/web/app/(auth)/` - Login/logout pages

## Dependencies
- [ ] PostgreSQL database running and accessible
- [ ] Environment variables configured (NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL)
- [ ] bcrypt package installed for password hashing
- [ ] NextAuth and PostgreSQL adapter packages installed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end (login/logout/protected routes)
- [ ] Role-based access control properly restricts access based on user role
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and patterns
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in authentication implementation
- [ ] Documentation updated for authentication setup and usage
