**Parallel Work:** #17, #19, #20 can be developed concurrently after #16

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation (Week 1)
- **Tasks:** #16, #17
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Status:** not_started
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - NextAuth.js configuration with role-based access
  - Route protection middleware
  - Database schema extensions for recipes

### Phase 2: Core Pages Development (Weeks 2-3)
- **Tasks:** #18, #19, #20 (parallel development)
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Status:** not_started
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Inventory Management UI with movement tracking
  - Reports Management UI with COGS breakdown
  - Recipes Management UI with CRUD operations

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Week 4)
- **Tasks:** #21
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Status:** not_started
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - End-to-end testing and workflow validation
  - Role enforcement and security audit
  - Performance optimization

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Authentication Integration Complexity**: First-time NextAuth setup with role management
  - *Mitigation*: Use existing Auth.js patterns, comprehensive testing
- **Performance with Large Datasets**: Inventory and reports pages with extensive data
  - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination and caching early

### Medium Risk Items
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Complex data tables and forms
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement approach
- **Database Schema Changes**: Adding recipes table and extending inventory
  - *Mitigation*: Careful migration planning and rollback procedures

### Low Risk Items
- **Component Integration**: Leveraging existing shadcn/ui components
- **API Extensions**: Following established tRPC patterns

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Page load times under 2 seconds
- [ ] 100% authentication coverage
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness score 95%+
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities

### Business Metrics
- [ ] 90% of workflows completable without Excel
- [ ] User satisfaction 4.5+ in beta testing
- [ ] 30% mobile usage within first month

## Dependencies Status
