# Task: Recipes Management Page

## Description
Build a comprehensive recipes management system with list view, detailed recipe display, admin CRUD operations, and operator integration for applying recipes to batch creation. The system will manage recipe templates with ingredients, process steps, and categorization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Recipe list with search functionality and category filtering implemented
- [ ] Recipe detail view displays ingredients, process steps, and metadata clearly
- [ ] Admin users can create, edit, and delete recipes with form validation
- [ ] Operators can apply recipes to batch creation with proper data integration
- [ ] Role-based access controls prevent unauthorized recipe modifications

## Technical Details
- Implement `/apps/web/src/app/recipes/page.tsx` and detail pages using shadcn/ui
- Create recipe forms with React Hook Form and Zod validation schemas
- Integrate search and filtering using TanStack Query for client-side caching
- Build "Apply Recipe" workflow that pre-populates batch creation forms
- Use role guards to conditionally render admin CRUD interfaces
- Files affected: recipes pages, recipe forms, batch integration, search components

## Dependencies
- [ ] Authentication system (Task 001) - required for role-based functionality
- [ ] API endpoints (Task 002) - required for recipe CRUD operations
- [ ] Recipe database schema - assumed to exist in core domain model
- [ ] Batch creation forms - may need modification for recipe integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18-22
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Recipe CRUD operations work correctly for admin users
- [ ] Search and filtering provide responsive user experience
- [ ] Recipe application to batch creation flows seamlessly
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid recipe data submission
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and passes quality checks
