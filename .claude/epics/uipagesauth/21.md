# Task: Integration & Testing

## Description
Final integration task to ensure all UI pages work together seamlessly with proper role enforcement, audit logging, and performance optimization. This includes comprehensive end-to-end testing of user workflows and system reliability under various conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Role enforcement verified across all pages with proper access controls
- [ ] End-to-end workflows tested (login → inventory → reports → recipes)
- [ ] Audit logging integration captures all user actions correctly
- [ ] Performance optimization completed with acceptable load times
- [ ] Error handling provides graceful degradation and user feedback

## Technical Details
- Create comprehensive E2E test suite covering all user roles and workflows
- Implement role-based route guards and API authorization checks
- Verify audit logging captures create/update/delete operations across all entities
- Optimize bundle sizes, implement code splitting, and add performance monitoring
- Add global error boundaries and network failure recovery mechanisms
- Files affected: middleware, guards, test suites, performance utilities, error handlers

## Dependencies
- [ ] Authentication system (Task 001) - must be complete for role testing
- [ ] API endpoints (Task 002) - must be complete for integration testing
- [ ] Inventory page (Task 003) - must be complete for workflow testing
- [ ] Reports page (Task 004) - must be complete for workflow testing
- [ ] Recipes page (Task 005) - must be complete for workflow testing
- [ ] Audit logging system - must be functional from core packages

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All end-to-end test scenarios pass consistently
- [ ] Role-based security verified through penetration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Error handling tested under network failure conditions
- [ ] Audit trail verification shows complete action logging
- [ ] Production readiness checklist completed and signed off
