# Task: Coverage & Quality Gates

## Description
Implement comprehensive coverage reporting and quality gates in CI/CD pipeline to enforce ≥95% code coverage, validate audit log snapshot testing, and prevent regression in testing standards. This task ensures long-term quality maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Coverage reporting configured with ≥95% threshold enforcement across all packages
- [ ] CI workflow fails when coverage drops below threshold with detailed reporting
- [ ] Audit log diff snapshots captured and validated in test runs
- [ ] Coverage trend tracking with historical comparison in CI reports
- [ ] Branch protection rules requiring test passage and coverage maintenance
- [ ] Performance monitoring for test suite execution time (≤60 seconds target)
- [ ] Quality metrics dashboard showing test health and coverage trends
- [ ] Automated coverage reporting in pull request comments

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Configure Vitest coverage with c8 for accurate TypeScript coverage measurement
  - Integrate coverage reporting into GitHub Actions with PR comments
  - Set up coverage trend tracking with historical data storage
  - Implement snapshot testing for audit log diffs with automated validation
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Coverage accuracy across TypeScript transpilation and source maps
  - Performance optimization for coverage collection in CI environment
  - False positive prevention in coverage measurement
  - Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline without disruption
- **Code Locations/Files Affected**:
  - `.github/workflows/test.yml` (CI pipeline with coverage gates)
  - `vitest.config.ts` (coverage configuration)
  - `/tests/snapshots/` (audit log snapshot files)
  - Coverage reporting and dashboard integration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Test Infrastructure Setup completed
- [ ] Task 002 - Business Calculation Unit Tests completed
- [ ] Task 003 - Business Rule Guards Implementation completed
- [ ] Task 004 - Integration Test Framework completed
- [ ] Task 005 - Audit Logging System completed
- [ ] GitHub repository with branch protection capabilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all other tasks completed)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive coverage reporting and quality gates
- [ ] Tests written for coverage and quality gate functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with quality standards and CI pipeline guide
- [ ] Code reviewed with focus on CI/CD reliability and coverage accuracy
- [ ] CI pipeline running with coverage enforcement and trend tracking
- [ ] Quality metrics dashboard operational and providing insights
