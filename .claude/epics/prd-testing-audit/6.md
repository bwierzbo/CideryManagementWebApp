# Task: Audit Logging System

## Description
Implement comprehensive audit logging system that automatically tracks all mutations with before/after snapshots, user attribution, and timestamp information. This system ensures 100% mutation coverage and provides complete audit trails for regulatory compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit log creation for all CREATE operations with complete entity snapshots
- [ ] Audit log creation for all UPDATE operations with before/after value diffs
- [ ] Audit log creation for all DELETE operations with final state capture
- [ ] User attribution for all audit entries with authentication context
- [ ] Timestamp precision with timezone information for all audit logs
- [ ] Audit log query functionality with filtering and pagination
- [ ] Snapshot diff generation and storage for change visualization
- [ ] Integration tests validating 100% mutation coverage in audit logs

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Implement audit middleware in tRPC procedures for automatic logging
  - Create audit log database schema with before/after JSON columns
  - Develop audit service in `packages/lib/src/audit/` for reusable audit functions
  - Use database triggers as backup for application-level audit logging
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Performance impact of audit logging on API response times
  - Storage efficiency for large audit log volumes
  - Data privacy and retention policies for audit information
  - Audit log integrity and tamper-proof storage
- **Code Locations/Files Affected**:
  - `packages/db/src/schema/audit.ts` (audit log schema)
  - `packages/lib/src/audit/` (audit service implementation)
  - `packages/api/src/middleware/audit.ts` (tRPC audit middleware)
  - `/tests/audit/` (audit logging tests and validation)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Test Infrastructure Setup completed
- [ ] Database schema implemented with audit log tables
- [ ] User authentication context available in API procedures
- [ ] JSON diff library for before/after comparison

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 28-36 hours
- Parallel: false (conflicts with business rules and integration tests)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive audit logging for all mutations
- [ ] Tests written verifying 100% mutation coverage in audit trails
- [ ] Documentation updated with audit logging architecture and usage
- [ ] Code reviewed with focus on data integrity and performance
- [ ] Audit log queries tested and optimized for reporting needs
- [ ] Snapshot diff functionality verified with test scenarios
