# Issue #2: Test Infrastructure Setup - Progress Report

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-09-12
**Commit**: 71a2f0a

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive Vitest testing infrastructure across the entire monorepo, establishing the foundation for all future testing tasks. The setup includes workspace configuration, coverage reporting, CI integration, and shared test utilities.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Core Infrastructure
- **Root-level Vitest workspace configuration** (`vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.workspace.ts`)
- **Package-specific configurations** for all 5 packages (web, api, db, lib, worker)
- **≥95% coverage thresholds** enforced across all packages (upgraded from 80% for lib)
- **Test directory structure** at `/tests` with package subdirectories

### ✅ Database Testing
- **PostgreSQL test containers** integration in db package using `@testcontainers/postgresql`
- **Database isolation** setup with proper cleanup between tests
- **Test database configuration** with migration support

### ✅ Shared Test Utilities
- **Test utilities** in `/tests/utils/` including:
  - Database helpers (cleanup, connection management)
  - Mock utilities (Next.js router, tRPC client, Auth.js session)
  - Test fixtures (users, vendors, purchases, batches)
  - Custom matchers (UUID validation, ABV validation, recent dates)
- **Cidery-specific test data** fixtures aligned with domain entities

### ✅ CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) with:
  - PostgreSQL service for database tests
  - Coverage reporting with Codecov integration
  - PR comment coverage reports using lcov-reporter-action
  - Build verification for all packages
  - Parallel test and build jobs for efficiency

### ✅ Package Configurations
- **Web package**: jsdom environment, React Testing Library, Vite React plugin
- **API package**: Node environment, tRPC testing setup
- **DB package**: PostgreSQL test containers, extended timeouts for container startup
- **Lib package**: Coverage threshold updated to 95% (from 80%)
- **Worker package**: Node environment, background job testing ready

### ✅ Command Integration
- **Root package.json** updated with unified test commands:
  - `pnpm test` - Run all tests across workspace
  - `pnpm test:watch` - Watch mode for development
  - `pnpm test:coverage` - Coverage reporting
  - `pnpm test:ui` - Vitest UI for interactive testing

## Verification

### ✅ Test Execution
- **All existing tests pass**: 104 tests across 4 test files in lib package
- **Workspace discovery**: Tests properly run with package prefixes (`|lib|`)
- **Error handling**: Audit system error scenarios working as expected

### ✅ Coverage Configuration
- **V8 coverage provider** configured
- **Multiple report formats**: text, json, html, lcov
- **Proper exclusions**: node_modules, dist, config files, generated code
- **Strict thresholds**: 95% branches, functions, lines, statements

## Technical Highlights

### Workspace Architecture
- **Vitest workspace** with package-specific configurations
- **Shared base configuration** extended by individual packages
- **Environment-specific setups** (jsdom for web, node for others)

### Database Testing Strategy
- **Test containers** for true isolation (no shared test databases)
- **Automatic cleanup** between test runs
- **Migration support** for schema evolution testing

### Coverage Strategy
- **Comprehensive exclusions** to focus on application code
- **Package-specific thresholds** while maintaining consistency
- **CI enforcement** with coverage gates

## Dependencies Added

### Root Level
- `vitest@^1.0.0`
- `@vitest/coverage-v8@^1.0.0`
- `@vitest/ui@^1.0.0`

### Web Package
- `@testing-library/jest-dom@^6.1.0`
- `@testing-library/react@^14.1.0`
- `@testing-library/user-event@^14.5.0`
- `@vitejs/plugin-react@^4.2.0`
- `jsdom@^23.0.0`

### Database Package
- `@testcontainers/postgresql@^10.5.0`

## Next Steps

With this foundational infrastructure in place, the following tasks can now proceed:

1. **Issue #3**: Component Testing (can use web package setup)
2. **Issue #4**: API Testing (can use api package setup)
3. **Issue #5**: Database Testing (can use db package setup with test containers)
4. **Issue #6**: E2E Testing (can build on existing infrastructure)

## Files Modified/Created

### Configuration Files
- `vitest.config.ts` (root workspace config)
- `vitest.workspace.ts` (workspace definition)
- `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
- `packages/api/vitest.config.ts`
- `packages/db/vitest.config.ts`
- `packages/worker/vitest.config.ts`

### Test Infrastructure
- `/tests/utils/` (shared utilities)
- `/tests/fixtures/` (test data)
- Package-specific `/tests/setup.ts` files

### CI/CD
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`

### Package Updates
- All `package.json` files updated with test scripts and dependencies

This comprehensive testing foundation ensures high code quality, proper test isolation, and efficient CI/CD processes for the entire Cidery Management App monorepo.
