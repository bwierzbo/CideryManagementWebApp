- **Durability**: Data persistence across connection resets
- **Complex Scenarios**: Nested transactions, savepoint simulation
- **Concurrency Testing**: High-load concurrent operation validation

#### 6. API Authentication & Authorization Tests (`api-endpoints.test.ts`)
- **Authentication Validation**: Protected vs public endpoint access
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Operator, Viewer permission testing
- **Complete API Workflows**: Purchase → Press → Batch → Packaging via API
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid data
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Capacity, availability, constraint validation
- **Performance Testing**: Concurrent API requests and large operations

#### 7. Error Handling & Rollback Tests (`error-handling-rollback.test.ts`)
- **Transaction Rollbacks**: Multi-table operation failures with complete rollback
- **Cascade Failures**: Complex workflow failure handling
- **Vessel State Recovery**: Proper state cleanup on failed operations
- **Inventory Rollbacks**: Atomic inventory update failures
- **Deadlock Handling**: Graceful concurrent operation conflict resolution
- **Data Integrity Recovery**: Orphaned record prevention and cleanup

#### 8. Performance Testing (`workflow-performance.test.ts`)
- **Single Operation Benchmarks**: Purchase, batch, inventory update performance
- **Large-Scale Operations**: High-volume data handling (100+ items)
- **Complex Workflow Performance**: Multi-stage operation timing
- **Concurrent Operation Performance**: Multiple simultaneous operations
- **Query Performance**: Complex aggregation and reporting queries
- **Memory Efficiency**: Large result set handling
- **Performance Thresholds**: Configurable performance expectations

### 🚀 Key Features

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
pnpm test tests/integration

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test tests/integration/workflows
pnpm test tests/integration/database
pnpm test tests/integration/auth
pnpm test tests/integration/performance

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage tests/integration
```

### Test Configuration

The tests use PostgreSQL testcontainers which require Docker to be running. Performance thresholds can be adjusted in `workflow-performance.test.ts`:

```typescript
const PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
  singlePurchaseMs: 100,
  largePurchaseMs: 500,
  batchCreationMs: 200,
  complexWorkflowMs: 2000,
  // ... adjust as needed
}
```

### Database Setup

Tests automatically:
1. Start PostgreSQL testcontainer
2. Run database migrations
3. Seed test data
4. Clean up between tests

No manual database setup required.
