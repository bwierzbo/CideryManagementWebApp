# Task: Business Rule Guards Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive business rule validation guards that prevent invalid operations like negative transfers, over-capacity moves, and measurement out-of-range values. These guards ensure data integrity and provide clear error messages to users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Transfer validation guards rejecting volumes exceeding vessel capacity
- [ ] Negative volume/quantity validation preventing invalid operations
- [ ] Packaging validation ensuring consumption doesn't exceed available volume
- [ ] Measurement range validation (ABV 0-20%, pH 2.5-4.5, gravity 1.000-1.200)
- [ ] Vessel state transition validation (empty → filling → fermenting → ready)
- [ ] User permission validation for all protected operations
- [ ] Clear, user-friendly error messages for all validation failures
- [ ] Integration tests verifying all guards function correctly

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Extend existing Zod schemas with custom business logic validators
  - Implement validation functions in `packages/lib/src/validation/`
  - Integrate guards into tRPC procedures using middleware
  - Create custom error types for different validation failures
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Performance impact of validation on API responses
  - Error message localization and user experience
  - Validation consistency across all API endpoints
  - Preventing validation bypass through direct database access
- **Code Locations/Files Affected**:
  - `packages/lib/src/validation/` (new validation functions)
  - `packages/api/src/middleware/` (validation middleware)
  - `packages/api/src/routers/` (integration into procedures)
  - `/tests/api/validation/` (validation tests)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Test Infrastructure Setup completed
- [ ] Existing tRPC procedures and schemas
- [ ] Database schema with vessel capacity and state fields
- [ ] Zod validation library integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-28 hours
- Parallel: true (conflicts with integration tests and audit logging)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all business rule validation guards
- [ ] Tests written for each validation scenario and error condition
- [ ] Documentation updated with validation rules and error handling
- [ ] Code reviewed with security and business logic focus
- [ ] Integration tests passing with validation enforcement
- [ ] User-friendly error messages verified in UI components
