# Task: Test Infrastructure Setup

## Description
Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure using Vitest across the monorepo with coverage reporting, CI integration, and test database configuration. This foundational task establishes the testing framework for all subsequent testing work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vitest configured in all packages (web, api, db, lib, worker) with shared configuration
- [ ] `/tests` directory structure created at root level with package subdirectories
- [ ] Coverage reporting configured with c8 and â‰¥95% threshold enforcement
- [ ] Test database setup with PostgreSQL test containers for isolation
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI workflow configured with test execution and coverage gates
- [ ] Test utilities and shared fixtures created for reusable test setup
- [ ] `pnpm test -w` command executes successfully across all packages

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Configure Vitest workspace in root with package-specific configurations
  - Set up test database with @testcontainers/postgresql for isolated testing
  - Create shared test utilities in `/tests/utils` for common test patterns
  - Integrate coverage reporting with PR comments and trend tracking
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Test isolation between packages to prevent interference
  - Performance optimization for fast test execution
  - Database cleanup between test runs
- **Code Locations/Files Affected**:
  - `vitest.config.ts` (root and packages)
  - `.github/workflows/test.yml`
  - `/tests/` directory structure
  - `package.json` scripts in all packages

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js 20+ and pnpm 8+ environment
- [ ] PostgreSQL available for test database
- [ ] GitHub repository for CI/CD setup
- [ ] Existing monorepo package structure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-24 hours
- Parallel: true (foundational work, no conflicts)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with Vitest configuration across all packages
- [ ] Tests written for test utilities themselves
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] CI pipeline running successfully with coverage reporting
- [ ] Test database isolation verified and working
