# Task: Integration Test Framework

## Description
Implement end-to-end integration tests for complete cidery workflows including transfers, packaging, and inventory operations. These tests validate business rule enforcement, database transactions, and multi-entity operations work correctly together.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration tests for complete transfer workflows (vessel-to-vessel, batch transfers)
- [ ] Integration tests for packaging operations with inventory updates and cost allocation
- [ ] Integration tests for multi-stage production workflows (press → fermentation → packaging)
- [ ] Database transaction testing ensuring data consistency across operations
- [ ] API endpoint testing with authentication and authorization verification
- [ ] Error handling and rollback testing for failed operations
- [ ] Performance testing for complex workflow operations
- [ ] Integration with seed data for realistic test scenarios

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create integration test suites in `/tests/integration/workflows/`
  - Use test database with realistic seed data for workflow testing
  - Implement test helpers for complex workflow setup and teardown
  - Test API endpoints end-to-end with database verification
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Test isolation and cleanup between integration tests
  - Realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios
  - Database transaction rollback testing for error conditions
  - API authentication and authorization in test environment
- **Code Locations/Files Affected**:
  - `/tests/integration/workflows/` (new integration tests)
  - `/tests/fixtures/` (workflow test data)
  - Database seed scripts for test scenarios
  - API endpoint integration tests

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Test Infrastructure Setup completed
- [ ] Task 003 - Business Rule Guards Implementation completed
- [ ] Database schema and seed data from Prompt 11
- [ ] tRPC procedures implemented and functional
- [ ] Authentication system working in test environment

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 32-40 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on business rule guards)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive integration tests for all workflows
- [ ] Tests written covering end-to-end business scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated with integration testing guide
- [ ] Code reviewed with focus on workflow coverage and data consistency
- [ ] All integration tests passing in CI with database validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for complex workflows
