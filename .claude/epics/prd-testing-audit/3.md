# Task: Business Calculation Unit Tests

## Description
Implement comprehensive unit tests for all critical business calculations including ABV, yield, variance, and COGS calculations. These tests ensure financial accuracy and business logic correctness with edge case coverage and boundary testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for ABV calculation functions with edge cases (0-20% range, precision testing)
- [ ] Unit tests for yield calculations across all production stages (pressing, fermentation, packaging)
- [ ] Unit tests for variance calculations and statistical functions with boundary conditions
- [ ] Unit tests for COGS allocation and cost calculation logic with complex scenarios
- [ ] Edge case testing for invalid inputs, boundary values, and error conditions
- [ ] Property-based testing for calculation functions where applicable
- [ ] All calculation tests achieve â‰¥98% code coverage
- [ ] Test execution completes in under 5 seconds for all calculation tests

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create test files in `/tests/lib/calculations/` mirroring the lib package structure
  - Use descriptive test names following "should [expected behavior] when [condition]" pattern
  - Implement test data factories for complex calculation scenarios
  - Use Vitest's describe/it structure with proper test isolation
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Test precision and rounding behavior for financial calculations
  - Validate error handling for invalid inputs (negative values, null/undefined)
  - Ensure calculations are deterministic and repeatable
  - Test calculation performance for large datasets
- **Code Locations/Files Affected**:
  - `/tests/lib/calculations/` (new directory)
  - `packages/lib/src/calculations/` (existing calculation functions)
  - Test data factories and fixtures

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Test Infrastructure Setup completed
- [ ] Business calculation functions implemented in lib package
- [ ] Zod schemas for calculation input validation
- [ ] Decimal.js library for precise financial calculations

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (after infrastructure setup)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive unit tests for all calculations
- [ ] Tests written covering 100% of business logic scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated with calculation testing examples
- [ ] Code reviewed with focus on test coverage and edge cases
- [ ] All tests passing in CI with coverage verification
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for calculation functions
