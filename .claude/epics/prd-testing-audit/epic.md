# Epic: Testing & Audit Guarantees

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive testing framework with Vitest and audit logging system that ensures 100% business rule enforcement and complete change tracking. The system will provide zero-defect production operations through automated testing, business rule guards, and complete audit trails for regulatory compliance.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for fast, modern testing with native TypeScript support
- **Test Structure**: `/tests` directory at root level with package-specific subdirectories
- **Database Testing**: Real PostgreSQL database with test containers for isolation
- **Audit Strategy**: Database triggers + application-level audit logging for redundancy
- **Coverage Tool**: Vitest's built-in coverage using c8 for accurate TypeScript coverage
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions with coverage gating and snapshot validation

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Test Utilities**: Shared test helpers for component testing with React Testing Library
- **Mock Providers**: tRPC and auth context providers for isolated component testing
- **Snapshot Testing**: Audit log UI components with visual regression detection
- **Error Boundary Testing**: Validation of user-friendly error messages for business rule violations

### Backend Services
- **Business Rule Guards**: Zod schema validation with custom business logic validators
- **Audit Logging Service**: Automatic audit trail generation for all mutations with before/after snapshots
- **Test Database**: Isolated test database with automatic cleanup and seeding
- **Coverage Integration**: API endpoint testing with mutation and query coverage validation

### Infrastructure
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with coverage reporting and failure gates
- **Test Database**: PostgreSQL test containers with automatic setup/teardown
- **Coverage Reporting**: Integrated coverage reports with PR comments and trend tracking
- **Snapshot Management**: Automated audit log snapshot generation and validation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation & Unit Testing (Week 1)
- Set up Vitest configuration across monorepo packages
- Implement business calculation unit tests (ABV, yield, variance, COGS)
- Create test utilities and shared fixtures
- Establish coverage reporting and CI integration

### Phase 2: Business Rule Guards (Week 2)
- Implement validation guards for transfers, packaging, and inventory
- Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Create integration tests for business rule enforcement
- Validate edge cases and boundary conditions

### Phase 3: Audit System (Week 3)
- Implement audit logging for all mutations with diff snapshots
- Create audit log query and validation systems
- Test audit trail completeness and integrity
- Integrate audit logging with existing tRPC procedures

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure**: Vitest setup, CI integration, coverage reporting
- [ ] **Unit Test Suite**: Business calculation testing with comprehensive edge cases
- [ ] **Business Rule Guards**: Validation logic and error handling implementation
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing with database transactions
- [ ] **Audit Logging System**: Complete mutation tracking with diff snapshots
- [ ] **Coverage & Quality Gates**: CI enforcement and snapshot validation
- [ ] **Documentation & Training**: Testing standards and developer guidelines

## Dependencies

- **Database Schema**: Complete Drizzle schema definitions (from Prompt 3)
- **tRPC Routers**: API procedures for mutation testing (from Prompt 7)
- **Seed Data**: Test fixtures and demo data (from Prompt 11)
- **Authentication**: User context for audit logging attribution
- **Business Logic**: Domain calculation functions in lib package

## Success Criteria (Technical)

- **Coverage**: â‰¥95% code coverage across all packages maintained
- **CI Integration**: `pnpm test -w` passes with zero failures in CI/CD
- **Audit Completeness**: 100% of mutations generate audit log entries with snapshots
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Zero critical business rules can be bypassed
- **Performance**: Test suite executes in under 60 seconds total
- **Reliability**: Tests are deterministic with no flaky failures
