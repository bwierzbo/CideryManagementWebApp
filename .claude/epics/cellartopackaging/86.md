# Task: Performance and Polish

## Description
Optimize database queries, add performance indexes, implement mobile responsiveness, and apply final polish to the cellar-to-packaging workflow. This task focuses on production readiness through performance tuning, user experience refinements, and comprehensive mobile support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database query optimization for all packaging endpoints
- [ ] Strategic indexes added for foreign keys and common query patterns
- [ ] Page load performance meets benchmarks (<1s for 1000 runs)
- [ ] Modal load times optimized (<500ms consistently)
- [ ] Packaging operation completion optimized (<2s including DB updates)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for all packaging interfaces
- [ ] Touch-optimized interactions for mobile bottling workflow
- [ ] Responsive table layouts for packaging run lists
- [ ] Mobile-friendly modal sizing and form layouts
- [ ] Optimized mobile export functionality
- [ ] Progressive loading for large packaging run datasets
- [ ] Lazy loading implementation for packaging detail data
- [ ] Caching strategy for frequently accessed reference data
- [ ] Error message improvements and user feedback polish
- [ ] Loading states and progress indicators throughout UI
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Final UI polish: spacing, typography, visual consistency
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting setup

## Technical Details
- Analyze slow queries using database query plans and EXPLAIN
- Add composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Implement query result caching for reference data (package sizes)
- Add pagination optimization for large packaging run lists
- Implement mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for adaptive layouts
- Optimize bundle size through code splitting and lazy loading
- Add React Query optimizations for data prefetching
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Add database connection pooling optimization
- Create performance monitoring dashboards
- Implement proper error boundaries with user-friendly messages
- Add skeleton loading states for all async operations
- Optimize image assets and implement responsive images
- Add database query logging and performance metrics
- Implement proper caching headers for static assets

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 85 (Integration Testing) completed for performance baseline
- [ ] Performance testing results available for optimization targets
- [ ] Production-like database environment for realistic testing
- [ ] Analytics/monitoring tools configured for performance tracking

## Effort Estimate
