# Stream B: Form Logic and API Integration

## Scope
Implement form logic with React Hook Form and integrate tRPC API

## Files
- apps/web/src/components/packaging/bottle-modal.tsx (extend with API integration)
- apps/web/src/app/cellar/page.tsx (connect API mutations)

## Progress
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded package sizes with tRPC getPackageSizes query
- ✅ Connected tRPC createFromCellar mutation in bottle modal
- ✅ Updated cellar page to remove onSubmit prop dependency
- ✅ Added loading states during API calls (mutation pending state)
- ✅ Implemented success toast notifications with loss calculation display
- ✅ Added error toast notifications with proper error handling
- ✅ Updated form submission to invalidate relevant queries on success
- ✅ Tested integration - build and lint successful
- ✅ Committed with Issue #81 format

## Implementation Details
- Package sizes are now loaded dynamically from database via tRPC
- Modal is self-contained and handles its own API interactions
- Success toast shows units produced and calculated loss percentage
- Error handling provides specific error messages from tRPC mutations
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions and provide user feedback
- Data refreshes automatically after successful packaging run creation

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
Stream B work is complete. All form logic and API integration implemented and tested.
