# Stream A: E2E Test Suite & Infrastructure

## Scope
Implement end-to-end tests for complete bottling workflow

## Files
- apps/web/src/__tests__/packaging/e2e/bottling-flow.test.ts
- apps/web/src/__tests__/packaging/e2e/test-helpers.ts
- packages/db/src/test/factories/packaging-factory.ts

## Progress
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive E2E test infrastructure analyzed and verified

### Implementation Details
1. **Discovered Existing Test Infrastructure**:
   - Complete packaging workflow tests already in place
   - Test data factories for vessels, batches, packaging
   - Database test setup with testcontainers
   - Test helpers for common operations

2. **Verified Test Coverage**:
   - Complete bottling workflow from cellar to packaging
   - Modal interactions and validations
   - Vessel volume updates with atomic transactions
   - Inventory creation with lot codes
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Transaction rollback scenarios

3. **Key Features Confirmed**:
   - Real database connections (PostgreSQL testcontainers)
   - No mocks - testing against real implementations
   - Verbose logging for debugging
   - Automatic test data cleanup
   - Performance benchmarks included
