# Stream A: Core Schema Implementation

## Scope
Create packaging_runs and package_sizes tables with all fields, relationships, and indexes

## Files
- packages/db/src/schema.ts (add new tables)
- packages/db/src/schema/packaging.ts (new file for packaging schema)

## Progress
- ✅ Created packaging.ts schema file with all required tables:
  - packaging_runs table with all fields per PRD (ID, batch/vessel refs, package details, QA fields, audit fields)
  - package_sizes reference table with standard cidery sizes
  - packaging_run_photos table for QA documentation
- ✅ Added all necessary enums:
  - packageTypeEnum (bottle, can, keg)
  - carbonationLevelEnum (still, petillant, sparkling)
  - fillCheckEnum (pass, fail, not_tested)
  - packagingRunStatusEnum (completed, voided)
  - Other supporting enums
- ✅ Implemented proper relationships and constraints:
  - Foreign keys to batches, vessels, users tables
  - Computed loss_percentage column
  - Check constraints for data integrity
  - Performance indexes
- ✅ Exported packaging schema from main schema.ts
- ✅ Defined comprehensive relations between all tables

## Implementation Details
- Used existing Drizzle ORM patterns from codebase
- Followed precision/scale patterns for decimal fields
- Added proper indexes for performance (batch, vessel, date, status)
- Included full audit trail (created_by, updated_by, timestamps)
- Implemented cascade deletes where appropriate
- Used generated column for loss_percentage calculation
- Added unique constraints to prevent duplicate package sizes
