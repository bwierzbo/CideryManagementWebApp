# Task: Packaging Detail View

## Description
Build a comprehensive packaging run detail page at /packaging/[id] that displays production data, traceability information, and QA metrics in organized card layouts. The page should provide operators with complete visibility into a specific packaging run's execution, source materials, and quality control data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] /packaging/[id] route created with dynamic packaging run ID
- [ ] Production card displays run date, batch source, package size, quantities (planned vs actual)
- [ ] Traceability card shows source batch details, vessel history, blend components if applicable
- [ ] QA card displays quality control measurements, testing results, approval status
- [ ] Equipment card shows packaging line used, operator, start/end times, downtime tracking
- [ ] Inventory card lists all inventory items created from this packaging run
- [ ] Navigation breadcrumbs from packaging list page
- [ ] Edit button to modify packaging run details (if permissions allow)
- [ ] Loading states during data fetching
- [ ] Error handling for non-existent packaging runs
- [ ] Print-friendly layout option
- [ ] Back to packaging list navigation

## Technical Details
- Create apps/web/src/app/packaging/[id]/page.tsx following existing detail page patterns
- Use shadcn/ui Card components for organized information display
- Implement tRPC packaging.getPackagingRun query for detailed data
- Include related data fetching (batch details, inventory items, QA records)
- Use Next.js dynamic routing with proper parameter validation
- Follow existing card layout patterns from batch and vessel detail pages
- Implement conditional rendering based on data availability
- Include proper TypeScript types for all component props
- Use loading skeletons for better UX during data fetching
- Implement responsive design for tablet and mobile viewing

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 80 (Packaging API Router) completed
- [ ] Task 82 (Packaging List Page) completed for navigation flow
- [ ] Existing shadcn/ui Card and layout components available
- [ ] tRPC infrastructure functional

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 7-8 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on 80 and 82)
