# Task: Packaging List Page

## Description
Create a comprehensive packaging runs index page at /packaging that displays all packaging runs with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities. The page should provide operators with a clear overview of all packaging activities and easy access to individual packaging run details.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] /packaging route created with index page
- [ ] Data table displays packaging runs with columns: date, batch name, package size, quantity, status
- [ ] Filter by date range (from/to date pickers)
- [ ] Filter by package size (dropdown from package_sizes)
- [ ] Filter by batch name (search input with autocomplete)
- [ ] Sort by date, batch name, package size, quantity (ascending/descending)
- [ ] Pagination with configurable page size (10, 25, 50, 100 items)
- [ ] Click on row navigates to individual packaging run detail page
- [ ] Loading states during data fetching
- [ ] Empty state when no packaging runs exist
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV/Excel) for filtered results
- [ ] Responsive design works on tablet and mobile

## Technical Details
- Create apps/web/src/app/packaging/page.tsx following existing page patterns
- Use shadcn/ui DataTable component for the main table
- Implement filter components using shadcn/ui form controls (DatePicker, Select, Input)
- Use tRPC packaging.getPackagingRuns query with proper filtering parameters
- Implement client-side pagination using TanStack Table
- Use Next.js router for navigation to detail pages
- Follow existing styling patterns and layout structure
