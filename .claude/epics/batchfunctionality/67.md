# Task: Transfer Operations - Implement vessel-to-vessel transfers with batch continuity

## Description
Implement comprehensive vessel-to-vessel transfer operations that maintain batch continuity throughout the transfer process. This includes volume tracking, loss calculations, vessel state updates, and atomic transaction handling to ensure data consistency during transfers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Transfer workflow maintains batch continuity across vessel changes
- [ ] Volume tracking accurately accounts for transfer amounts and losses
- [ ] Atomic operations ensure transfer consistency (all-or-nothing)
- [ ] Source vessel volume decreases by transferred amount plus losses
- [ ] Destination vessel volume increases by exact transferred amount
- [ ] Batch vessel location updated to destination vessel upon completion
- [ ] Transfer events logged with complete operation details
- [ ] Loss calculations recorded as separate batch events
- [ ] Transfer validation prevents invalid operations (insufficient volume, vessel capacity)
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for failed transfers

## Technical Details
- Implement transfer procedures in batch API with atomic database transactions
- Create transfer validation logic for volume checks and vessel compatibility
- Add transfer event types to batch event system (transfer_start, transfer_complete, transfer_loss)
- Implement volume calculation and loss tracking algorithms
- Create transfer form UI components with real-time validation
- Add transfer history display to batch timeline
- Implement rollback procedures for failed transfers
- Integrate with existing vessel capacity and state management
- Add transfer audit logging for compliance tracking

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Database Schema) completed - requires batches and batch_events tables
- [ ] Task 002 (Batch API Layer) completed - requires batch management endpoints
- [ ] Task 004 (Event System) completed - requires event creation infrastructure
- [ ] Existing vessel management system available
- [ ] Volume calculation utilities accessible

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Transfer operations update batch vessel location correctly
- [ ] Volume tracking maintains accurate balances throughout transfers
- [ ] Loss calculations recorded as distinct batch events
- [ ] Atomic transactions ensure data consistency during transfers
- [ ] Transfer validation prevents invalid operations with clear error messages
- [ ] Transfer history fully integrated into batch event timeline
- [ ] Rollback mechanism handles failed transfers gracefully
- [ ] Transfer forms provide real-time validation and user feedback
- [ ] All transfer operations logged to audit system
- [ ] Integration tests verify transfer scenarios including edge cases
- [ ] Performance testing confirms transfer operations complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] Documentation updated with transfer workflow procedures
