# Task: Event Timeline Component - Build chronological display of batch events with visualization

## Description
Create a comprehensive timeline component that displays all batch events chronologically with type-specific visualizations, providing operators with complete visibility into batch history and operations. The timeline serves as the primary interface for understanding batch progression and troubleshooting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BatchEventTimeline component displays events in chronological order
- [ ] Type-specific event rendering (measurements, additives, transfers, etc.)
- [ ] Interactive timeline with expandable event details
- [ ] Visual indicators for event types with icons and color coding
- [ ] Event filtering and search functionality
- [ ] Pagination or virtual scrolling for large event histories
- [ ] Export functionality for event data and timeline
- [ ] Integration with batch details interface
- [ ] Real-time updates when new events are added

## Technical Details
- Create BatchEventTimeline component with scrollable timeline layout
- Implement EventItem components for different event types (measurement, additive, transfer)
- Add event type icons and color scheme for visual distinction
- Create expandable event cards with full details and metadata
- Implement filtering controls for event types and date ranges
- Add search functionality for event content and notes
- Use virtualization for performance with large event datasets
- Integrate with batch API for real-time event fetching
- Add export functionality for timeline data (PDF/CSV)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 (Batch API Layer) completed
- [ ] Task 004 (Event System Integration) completed
- [ ] Event data available through API
- [ ] shadcn/ui components for timeline layout

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Timeline displays all batch events chronologically
- [ ] Event types have distinct visual representations
- [ ] Event details expandable with full information display
- [ ] Filtering and search working correctly
- [ ] Performance optimized for large event histories
- [ ] Export functionality generates proper reports
- [ ] Real-time updates working when events are added
- [ ] Integration with batch details UI seamless
- [ ] User testing confirms timeline is intuitive and useful
- [ ] Accessibility standards met for timeline navigation
