# Epic: Enhanced Pressing Page Functionality

## Overview
Transform the existing pressing page from basic press run management into a comprehensive, data-driven production system with real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation. This epic focuses on leveraging existing infrastructure while adding IoT integration, advanced analytics, and workflow automation to achieve 25% yield improvement and 90% reduction in quality incidents.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Choices
- **Real-time Data:** WebSocket integration with existing tRPC v11 architecture
- **IoT Integration:** MQTT protocol with Node.js message broker for sensor data ingestion
- **Analytics Engine:** PostgreSQL with time-series optimization + lightweight ML models using existing Drizzle ORM
- **Background Processing:** Extend existing worker package for predictive analytics and automated scheduling
- **Frontend:** Enhance existing Next.js 15 pressing page with real-time components using shadcn/ui

### Design Patterns
- **Event-driven Architecture:** MQTT → Worker → Database → WebSocket → Frontend pipeline
- **Command Query Separation:** Separate read-optimized views for analytics from write operations
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Build on existing pressing workflow with additive features
- **Microservice Integration:** Extend existing tRPC routers with dedicated monitoring/analytics modules

### Database Strategy
- **Extend Existing Schema:** Add 4 new tables (pressing_parameters, equipment_status, quality_tests, yield_predictions)
- **Time-series Optimization:** Partition pressing_parameters by timestamp for performance
- **Analytics Views:** Materialized views for complex analytics queries
- **Data Retention:** Automated archival after 2 years for historical data

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Real-time Dashboard:** WebSocket-powered live monitoring overlay on existing pressing page
- **Alert System:** Toast notifications + badge system integrated with existing navbar
- **Analytics Widgets:** Embedded charts and KPI cards using existing component patterns
- **Automation Panels:** Smart vessel assignment and scheduling interfaces
- **Quality Gates:** Workflow checkpoints integrated with existing press run forms

### Backend Services
- **IoT Data Ingestion Service:** MQTT subscriber in worker package with Redis buffering
- **Analytics Engine:** PostgreSQL functions + Node.js ML service for yield predictions
- **Alert Manager:** Event-driven notification system with email/SMS integration
- **Automation Services:** Schedule optimizer and vessel assignment algorithms
- **Quality Control:** Automated testing integration with hold/release workflows

### Infrastructure
- **WebSocket Server:** Dedicated server for real-time data streaming to frontend
- **MQTT Broker:** Lightweight broker for IoT device communication
- **Background Jobs:** Extend existing worker with analytics and maintenance prediction jobs
- **API Gateway:** Extend existing tRPC with new routers for monitoring, analytics, automation

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation (4 weeks):** Database extensions + basic IoT integration + real-time dashboard
2. **Intelligence (3 weeks):** Analytics engine + predictive models + quality control automation
3. **Automation (3 weeks):** Scheduling optimization + vessel assignment + documentation generation

### Risk Mitigation
- **IoT Complexity:** Start with temperature sensors only, expand gradually
- **Performance Impact:** Implement data aggregation and caching layers
- **User Adoption:** Additive features that enhance existing workflow without disruption

### Testing Approach
- **Integration Tests:** IoT data flow from sensors → database → frontend
- **Performance Tests:** Real-time data handling under load (50+ concurrent users)
- **User Acceptance:** Gradual rollout with operator feedback integration
