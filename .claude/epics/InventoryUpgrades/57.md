# Task: Table Sorting & Search - Implement column sorting and real-time search

## Description
Implement comprehensive sorting functionality for all table columns and optimize the search functionality for real-time performance. This task enhances the user experience by providing intuitive data organization and fast search results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement column sorting for all columns (Name, Type, Quantity, Location, Date)
- [ ] Add visual indicators for sort direction (up/down arrows)
- [ ] Real-time search functionality with <300ms response time
- [ ] Maintain existing pagination after sorting/searching
- [ ] Support multi-column sorting (optional enhancement)
- [ ] Preserve sort state when filters are applied

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Extend table component with sorting hooks
- Files affected:
  - Inventory table component from task 007
  - Search input component from task 007
  - Table header components for sort indicators
- Use React state management for sort configuration
- Implement debounced search to optimize performance
- Ensure sorting works with filtered data
- Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 007 (Enhanced Inventory Table) must be completed
- [ ] Table structure and search input must be in place
- [ ] Material type filtering must be functional

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and follows existing patterns
- [ ] Tests written and passing for sorting functionality
- [ ] Tests written and passing for search performance
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] All columns can be sorted in both directions
- [ ] Search responds within 300ms for datasets up to 1000 items
- [ ] Sort state persists during filtering operations
