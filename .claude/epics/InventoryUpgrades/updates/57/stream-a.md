# Issue #57 - Column Sorting Implementation (Stream A)

## Progress Status: IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Implementing comprehensive column sorting functionality for the InventoryTable component with reusable hooks and components.

## Work Completed
- [x] Read and analyzed existing InventoryTable implementation from Issue #56
- [x] Set up progress tracking structure

## Current Work
- [ ] Create reusable `useTableSorting` hook for state management
- [ ] Create `SortableHeader` component with visual indicators
- [ ] Refactor `InventoryTable` to use new hook and component
- [ ] Add multi-column sorting support
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility

## Technical Decisions
- Building on existing sorting functionality in InventoryTable.tsx
- Following shadcn/ui patterns for component structure
- Using TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Implementing three-way sorting: ascending → descending → none

## Files to Create/Modify
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useTableSorting.ts` (new)
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/sortable-header.tsx` (new)
- `apps/web/src/components/inventory/InventoryTable.tsx` (update)

## Performance Target
- <100ms sorting response time

## Next Steps
Starting with the useTableSorting hook to extract the sorting logic from the existing implementation.
