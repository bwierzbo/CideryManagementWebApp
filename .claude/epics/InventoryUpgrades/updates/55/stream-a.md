# Issue #55: API Structure & Types - Stream A Progress

## Work Completed

### 1. Created Comprehensive Transaction Type Definitions
- **File**: `packages/api/src/types/inventory.ts`
- **Created discriminated union types** based on materialType enum ('apple', 'additive', 'juice', 'packaging')
- **Implemented type-safe schemas** with material-specific validation:
  - **Apple transactions**: Variety ID, vendor, quality grade, harvest date, storage location
  - **Additive transactions**: Type, name, concentration, expiration, storage requirements
  - **Juice transactions**: Press run, vessel, volume, brix, pH, variety composition
  - **Packaging transactions**: Type, size, color, material, supplier details

### 2. Defined Comprehensive Zod Schemas
- **Base transaction schema** with common fields (date, reason, notes)
- **Material-specific schemas** extending base with discriminated unions
- **Input validation schemas** for queries (list, search) with proper limits and filters
- **Type exports** for use across the application

### 3. Created Base Inventory Router Structure
- **File**: `packages/api/src/routers/inventory.ts`
- **RBAC integration** using existing `createRbacProcedure` pattern
- **Audit logging** following established eventBus pattern
- **Database operations** with proper error handling and transactions

### 4. Implemented Type-Safe recordTransaction Endpoint
- **Input validation** with Zod schemas ensuring data integrity
- **Transaction safety** with database rollback on errors
- **Inventory validation** preventing negative stock levels
- **Audit trail** with comprehensive event logging
- **Error handling** with proper TRPCError responses

## Router Endpoints Created

1. **`list`** - Paginated inventory listing with filters
2. **`getById`** - Individual item details with transaction history
3. **`search`** - Full-text search with material type filtering
4. **`recordTransaction`** - Type-safe transaction recording
5. **`getTransactionHistory`** - Paginated transaction history
6. **`getSummaryByMaterialType`** - Aggregate statistics

## Architecture Decisions

### Schema Design
- Used **discriminated unions** for type safety across material types
- **Separated concerns** between simple transaction recording and complex material creation
- **Maintained backwards compatibility** with existing database schema

### Database Integration
- **Worked within existing constraints** (packageId requirement in inventory table)
- **Focused on transaction recording** rather than inventory item creation for MVP
- **Proper foreign key relationships** with existing tables

### Type Safety
- **Full type coverage** from input validation to database operations
- **Material-specific validation** ensuring data quality
- **Export types** for frontend consumption

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All assigned work for Stream A has been completed:
- ✅ Comprehensive transaction type definitions with discriminated unions
- ✅ Zod schemas for each transaction type (apple, additive, juice, packaging)
- ✅ Base inventory router structure with tRPC
- ✅ Type-safe input validation for recordTransaction endpoint

## Files Modified
- **Created**: `packages/api/src/types/inventory.ts`
- **Created**: `packages/api/src/routers/inventory.ts`

## Next Steps for Integration
1. **Stream B**: Frontend components can now use these types
2. **Stream C**: Mobile app can consume the type-safe API endpoints
3. **Router registration**: Add inventory router to main API router
4. **Database migrations**: Consider inventory schema improvements for raw materials

## Notes
- The current implementation works within existing database constraints
- Material-specific validation ensures data quality
- Type safety is maintained throughout the entire stack
- Ready for frontend and mobile integration
