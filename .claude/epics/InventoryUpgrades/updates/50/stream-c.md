# Issue #50 - Stream C: Seed Data Updates

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

## Work Completed

### 1. Schema Updates
- Added `material_type` enum with values: `apple`, `additive`, `juice`, `packaging`
- Updated inventory table schema with:
  - `materialType` column (default: 'apple')
  - `metadata` JSONB column (default: '{}')

### 2. Database Migration
- Generated migration `0004_fresh_paper_doll.sql`
- Migration includes enum creation and inventory table alterations
- Maintains backward compatibility with default values

### 3. Seed Data Enhancements
- Updated existing inventory items with material types and detailed metadata
- Added diverse inventory examples showcasing all 4 material types:

#### Apple Products (Finished Cider)
- 750ml bottles: ABV, batch numbers, variety blends, tasting notes
- 375ml bottles: Tasting room specific metadata

#### Additives
- Potassium metabisulfite: Concentration, safety notes, application rates, storage requirements

#### Juice (Raw Materials)
- Fresh pressed juice: Brix, pH, variety composition, storage conditions, expiration dates

#### Packaging Materials
- Glass bottles: Supplier info, dimensions, quality specifications, order tracking

### 4. Inventory Transactions
- Added sample transactions for all material types
- Demonstrates different transaction types: sales, transfers, production use

### 5. Testing
- Verified TypeScript compilation passes
- Confirmed seed script syntax is valid
- Ready for database deployment when database is available
