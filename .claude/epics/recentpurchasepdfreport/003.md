# Task: Date Range Reporting System - Configurable period reports with filtering and customization

## Description
Implement a comprehensive date range reporting system with configurable period selection, vendor filtering, apple variety filtering, cost thresholds, and multiple report format options. This provides internal analysis capabilities with detailed accounting reports, summary reports, and executive overviews for business operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Date range picker with presets (7 days, 30 days, custom ranges)
- [ ] Vendor selection filtering with multi-select capabilities
- [ ] Apple variety filtering and cost threshold settings
- [ ] Multiple report template options (summary, detailed, accounting)
- [ ] Async processing for large dataset reports (500+ purchases)
- [ ] Progress tracking and real-time status updates
- [ ] Report preview functionality before generation
- [ ] Report history and re-download capabilities
- [ ] Export options (PDF download, email sharing)

## Technical Details
- Create `DateRangeTemplate`, `AccountingTemplate`, and `SummaryTemplate` classes
- Implement `ReportGeneratorPage` with configuration interface
- Build `DateRangePicker` component with calendar integration and presets
- Develop `ReportFilters` component for vendor, variety, and cost filtering
- Add `generateDateRange`, `generateAccounting`, `generateSummary` endpoints
- Implement async processing with job queue for large reports
- Create `ProgressIndicator` component for real-time generation status
- Build report preview functionality with PDF viewer component
- Add report history tracking and re-download capabilities
- Implement caching for frequently requested configurations

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: PDF Generation Infrastructure completed
- [ ] Existing purchase data API with filtering capabilities
- [ ] Background job processing system (or implement simple async handling)
- [ ] File storage system for temporary report caching

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: false
