# Task 005 Analysis: Report Management Interface

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Core Components (Independent - 8-10 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/DateRangePicker.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportFilters.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/ProgressIndicator.tsx`

**Work Items:**
- Create DateRangePicker with calendar integration and presets
- Build ReportFilters for vendor/variety/cost selection
- Implement ProgressIndicator for generation status
- Add form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility

### Stream B: Report Dashboard (Independent - 6-8 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `apps/web/src/app/reports/`
- `apps/web/src/app/reports/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportGeneratorPage.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportPreview.tsx`

**Work Items:**
- Create main ReportGeneratorPage dashboard
- Implement report type selection interface
- Build ReportPreview with PDF viewer
- Add report history and re-download functionality
- Integrate with routing and navigation

### Stream C: Purchase Integration (Depends on existing codebase - 4-6 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `apps/web/src/components/purchases/`
- `apps/web/src/components/purchases/PurchaseOrderActions.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/purchases/VendorEmailModal.tsx`

**Work Items:**
- Integrate PurchaseOrderActions into existing purchase UI
- Create VendorEmailModal for email composition
- Add one-click PDF generation buttons
- Implement delivery tracking display
- Update existing purchase detail views

## Coordination Requirements

1. **Stream A and B can work independently** until integration
2. **Stream C requires analysis** of existing purchase management UI
3. **All streams need placeholder API** calls (mock for now)
4. **Final integration** requires completed PDF infrastructure (Task 001)

## Definition of Done per Stream

### Stream A Complete:
- DateRangePicker with calendar, presets, validation
- ReportFilters with multi-select, search, clear functionality
- ProgressIndicator with real-time updates (mock WebSocket)
- All components responsive and accessible
- React Hook Form integration with Zod schemas

### Stream B Complete:
- ReportGeneratorPage with type selection and configuration
- ReportPreview with PDF viewer component
- Report history with metadata display
- Navigation and routing properly integrated
- TanStack Query setup for data fetching (mock endpoints)

### Stream C Complete:
- PurchaseOrderActions integrated into existing purchase views
- VendorEmailModal with template selection and composition
- One-click generation buttons with proper state management
- Delivery tracking status display
- Audit trail integration for email activities

## Integration Points

- Stream A components integrate into Stream B dashboard
- Stream B provides main interface for report generation
- Stream C extends existing purchase management workflow
- All streams use shared design system and state management
- Mock API calls will be replaced with real tRPC endpoints after Task 001
