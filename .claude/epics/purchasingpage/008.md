# Task 008: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing coverage for the purchasing page epic, including unit conversion accuracy, COGS calculation validation, and end-to-end golden path testing. This task ensures all implemented features work correctly in isolation and integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Unit test suite for bushel conversion with ±0.1% error tolerance testing
- [ ] COGS calculation testing with mixed free/paid purchase scenarios
- [ ] Invoice number uniqueness testing with concurrent generation
- [ ] Form validation testing for optional weight/cost fields

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Golden path integration testing (purchase → press → batch → package → report)
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete purchase workflow with new features
- [ ] Backwards compatibility testing for existing purchase data

### Device & Platform Testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing on tablets for harvest date picker and variety workflow
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing for purchase forms

### Data Migration & Production Testing
- [ ] Migration testing with existing production data copies
- [ ] Data integrity validation for converted purchase records

## Technical Details

### Testing Framework Requirements
- **Jest** for unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Cypress** for end-to-end integration testing
- **Mobile device testing** on actual tablet hardware
- **Data migration validation** with production data copies

### Test Coverage Areas
1. **Unit Conversion Logic**
   - Bushel-to-pound conversion accuracy
   - Error tolerance validation (±0.1%)
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions

2. **COGS Calculations**
   - Mixed free/paid purchase scenarios
   - Weighted average cost calculations
   - Cost allocation across batches

3. **Form Validation**
   - Optional field handling
   - Required field enforcement
   - Data type validation

4. **Workflow Integration**
   - Complete purchase-to-package pipeline
   - Data consistency across entities
   - State management validation

5. **Production Readiness**
   - Performance under load
   - Data migration safety
   - Backwards compatibility

## Dependencies

This task depends on completion of all implementation tasks:
- [001] Enhanced Purchase Form UI/UX
- [002] Advanced Variety Management
- [003] Unit Conversion & Validation
- [004] COGS Calculation Engine
- [005] Invoice Management System
- [006] Enhanced Reporting Features
- [007] Mobile Optimization

## Success Metrics

- 100% test coverage for new purchase functionality
- All unit tests pass with ±0.1% accuracy tolerance
- Golden path E2E tests complete successfully
- Mobile workflow validated on tablet devices
- Production data migration validated without data loss
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements

## Notes

- Testing must be comprehensive and verbose for debugging purposes
- No mock services - test against real implementations
- Complete current test suite before moving to next area
- Focus on real-world usage scenarios and edge cases
