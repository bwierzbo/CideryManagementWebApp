# Task: Tank Status Management - Implement automatic status transitions and manual overrides

## Description
Implement business logic for automatic tank status transitions based on operations (transfers, measurements, time) and provide manual override capabilities for operators. This creates the core tank management workflow that automatically tracks tank states while allowing operator control when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic status transitions implemented (empty → cleaning → sanitizing → filling → fermenting → conditioning → transferring → empty)
- [ ] Manual status override functionality with audit logging
- [ ] Status validation rules prevent invalid transitions
- [ ] Business logic handles edge cases (partial fills, emergency stops, equipment failures)
- [ ] Tank status history tracking for audit purposes
- [ ] Integration with existing vessel management system

## Technical Details
- Create tank status management service in `packages/lib/src/tank-status/`
- Implement state machine pattern for status transitions
- Add validation rules for status changes
- Create manual override functions with proper authorization
- Integrate with existing vessel and batch management
- Add audit logging for all status changes
- Handle concurrent status updates safely

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (database schema updates)
- [ ] Existing vessel management system understood
- [ ] Audit logging system available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Core status management logic implemented
- [ ] Automatic transitions working correctly
- [ ] Manual override functionality complete
- [ ] Comprehensive tests covering all transitions
- [ ] Status validation prevents invalid states
- [ ] Audit logging captures all changes
- [ ] Code reviewed for business logic correctness
