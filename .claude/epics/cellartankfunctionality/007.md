# Task: Mobile UI Components

## Description
Build responsive mobile-first UI components for tank measurement recording and additive management. Create intuitive forms and interfaces optimized for tablet and mobile use in production environments, with offline capabilities and barcode scanning integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Mobile-optimized measurement recording forms with large touch targets
- [ ] Barcode scanning interface for additive identification and verification
- [ ] Offline form submission queue with sync when connectivity restored
- [ ] Voice notes recording for operator comments during measurements
- [ ] Camera integration for visual documentation of tank conditions
- [ ] Quick measurement templates for common test types (gravity, pH, SO2)
- [ ] Gesture-based navigation for single-handed operation
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) installation capability
- [ ] Dark mode support for low-light cellar environments

## Technical Details
- Create new mobile component library in `apps/web/src/components/mobile/`
