# Task: API Integration - Extend tRPC routers with tank-specific endpoints

## Description
Extend the existing tRPC API layer with tank-specific endpoints for status management, measurements, and additives. This provides type-safe API access to tank functionality for the frontend application and ensures proper data validation and error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tank status endpoints (get, update, history)
- [ ] Measurement endpoints (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Additive endpoints (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Tank listing and filtering endpoints
- [ ] Input validation using Zod schemas
- [ ] Proper error handling and status codes
- [ ] Type safety maintained across API boundaries

## Technical Details
- Extend `packages/api/src/routers/` with tank-specific router
- Create Zod schemas for tank operations in `packages/api/src/schemas/`
- Implement CRUD operations for measurements and additives
- Add tank status management procedures
- Integrate with existing vessel router where appropriate
- Ensure proper authorization and RBAC integration
- Add comprehensive input validation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing tRPC infrastructure
- [ ] Zod validation schemas
- [ ] RBAC system integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Tank router implemented with all endpoints
- [ ] Zod schemas created for input validation
- [ ] API endpoints tested with proper data flow
- [ ] Type safety verified across API boundaries
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Authorization properly integrated
- [ ] Code reviewed for API design best practices
