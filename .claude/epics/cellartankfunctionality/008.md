# Task: Testing & Documentation

## Description
Comprehensive test coverage for all tank functionality features including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end testing, and complete user documentation. Ensure system reliability and provide clear guidance for operators and administrators.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all tank functionality business logic (>95% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for tank status workflows and API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete tank management user journeys
- [ ] Performance testing for real-time status updates and data synchronization
- [ ] Security testing for tank operation permissions and audit logging
- [ ] User documentation with step-by-step operational procedures
- [ ] API documentation for tank management endpoints
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common tank operation issues
- [ ] Training materials for new operator onboarding

## Technical Details
- Create comprehensive test suite in `packages/api/src/routers/tank.test.ts`
- Add integration tests in `apps/web/__tests__/tank-functionality/`
- Implement E2E tests using Playwright for tank workflows
- Performance tests for concurrent tank operations and real-time updates
- Security tests for RBAC and audit trail verification
- Create documentation in `docs/` directory with operational procedures
- Generate OpenAPI documentation for tank management API
- Build interactive training materials with screenshots and videos

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Tank Data Model (schema and validations)
- [ ] Task 002: Tank Status Management (business logic)
