# Task: Measurement Recording System

## Description
Build comprehensive measurement recording system for cellar tank management, including forms for capturing various measurement types (SG, pH, temperature, sulfites), API endpoints for data persistence, and historical views for tracking measurement trends over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Measurement recording form with support for all measurement types (SG, pH, temperature, sulfites, custom)
- [ ] Real-time validation of measurement values with appropriate ranges
- [ ] API endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving measurements
- [ ] Historical measurement views with charts and trend analysis
- [ ] Measurement search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Integration with vessel/batch context for proper data association
- [ ] Measurement templates for common testing scenarios
- [ ] Export functionality for measurement data
- [ ] Measurement comparison tools between batches/vessels

## Technical Details
- Extend existing measurement schema in packages/db with additional fields
- Create tRPC procedures in packages/api for measurement operations
- Build React components in apps/web for measurement forms and displays
- Implement measurement validation logic in packages/lib
- Use TanStack Query for optimistic updates and caching
- Integrate with existing vessel and batch management systems
- Implement measurement charts using recharts or similar library

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Vessel Status Management System (for vessel context)
- [ ] Task 003: Vessel API Integration (for data layer)
- [ ] Existing vessel and batch schemas
- [ ] Authentication and authorization system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and integrated with existing vessel system
- [ ] Comprehensive tests written and passing
- [ ] Measurement validation logic tested
- [ ] API endpoints tested with edge cases
- [ ] UI components tested for usability
- [ ] Historical views display correctly
- [ ] Export functionality works
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
