# Task: Database Safety System - Non-destructive migrations and monitoring

## Description
Create non-destructive Phase 1 migrations that rename unused elements to deprecated rather than dropping them. Implement monitoring and telemetry for deprecated elements to ensure they're truly unused. Create rollback procedures and backup validation before implementing Phase 2 removal process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Phase 1 migration system for non-destructive deprecation
- [ ] Deprecated element naming convention implemented
- [ ] Monitoring/telemetry system for deprecated element access
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Backup validation system implemented
- [ ] Phase 2 removal process documented (not executed)
- [ ] Safety checks prevent accidental data loss
- [ ] Migration history tracking for audit purposes

## Technical Details
- Implement `_deprecated_YYYYMMDD` naming convention for tables/columns
- Create Drizzle migration templates for safe deprecation
- Add database triggers or middleware to log access to deprecated elements
- Build rollback migration generator for emergency restoration
- Implement backup verification before any schema changes
- Create monitoring dashboard for deprecated element usage
- Document Phase 2 process with approval workflows

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 completed with list of unused elements
- [ ] Database backup and restore procedures verified
- [ ] Monitoring infrastructure available
- [ ] Team approval for deprecation strategy

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10-14 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Phase 1 migration system implemented and tested
- [ ] Monitoring system tracks deprecated element access
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested on staging environment
- [ ] Backup validation automated and verified
- [ ] Documentation complete for Phase 2 process
- [ ] Safety checks prevent data loss
- [ ] Migration can be executed with confidence
- [ ] Team trained on new deprecation workflow
