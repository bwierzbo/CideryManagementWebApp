# Task: Validation & Testing - Comprehensive testing of all cleanup categories

## Description
Execute comprehensive testing across all cleanup categories to validate safety, performance, and correctness of automated cleanup processes. This includes performance benchmarking, migration testing in isolated environments, and rollback procedure validation to ensure zero functional changes and complete reversibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance benchmarks collected before/after cleanup (build time, bundle size, type check time, dev server start)
- [ ] All cleanup categories tested in isolated test environment
- [ ] Migration testing validates database schema changes without functional impact
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and verified for all cleanup categories
- [ ] Integration tests verify no runtime errors in development/production scenarios
- [ ] Static analysis validation confirms tool outputs against known test cases
- [ ] Full monorepo analysis and cleanup simulation executed successfully
- [ ] CI pipeline integration tested with quality gates and performance monitoring
- [ ] Test isolation maintained with separate environment for migration validation
- [ ] Incremental rollout validation with category-based cleanup testing

## Technical Details
- Set up isolated test environment mirroring production monorepo structure
- Execute performance benchmarking suite capturing baseline metrics
- Run full cleanup simulation with all analysis tools (knip, ts-prune, depcheck, madge)
- Test database migration scripts in isolated PostgreSQL instance
- Validate rollback migrations restore exact original state
- Execute comprehensive test suite after each cleanup category
- Monitor for any runtime errors or performance regressions
- Test CI integration with automated cleanup checks and quality gates
- Validate asset optimization and duplicate detection accuracy
- Test dependency management changes with lockfile regeneration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 (Code & Asset Cleanup) completed
- [ ] Task 003 (Dependency Management) completed
- [ ] Task 005 (Database Safety System) completed
- [ ] Isolated test environment configured
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics established
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite available and passing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show targeted improvements (25% build time, 20% bundle size, 30% type check, 15% dev server)
- [ ] All cleanup categories pass validation testing without functional changes
- [ ] Database migration testing confirms zero impact on existing functionality
- [ ] Rollback procedures successfully restore original state for all changes
- [ ] Integration tests demonstrate no runtime errors or regressions
- [ ] CI pipeline quality gates prevent merge of new technical debt
- [ ] Test coverage includes edge cases and error scenarios for each cleanup category
- [ ] Performance monitoring validates no degradation in database queries or application performance
- [ ] Static analysis tools show zero false positives in controlled test scenarios
- [ ] Full documentation of test results and validation procedures completed
