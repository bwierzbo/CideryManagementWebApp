- [ ] Maintenance procedures established for ongoing technical debt prevention
- [ ] Tool configuration documentation for all analysis tools (knip, ts-prune, depcheck, madge)
- [ ] Database safety system documentation with migration procedures
- [ ] CI integration guide with quality gate configuration
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues and edge cases
- [ ] Performance benchmarking procedures and baseline establishment
- [ ] Team training materials for cleanup system usage

## Technical Details
