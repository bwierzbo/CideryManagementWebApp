# Task: Dependency Management

## Description
Clean up project dependencies using depcheck analysis results. Remove unused dependencies, fix missing peerDependencies, regenerate lockfiles safely, and validate that builds continue to work. This task focuses on reducing bundle size and eliminating unnecessary packages while maintaining functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unused dependencies identified and safely removed using depcheck results
- [ ] Missing peerDependencies detected and added to appropriate packages
- [ ] Package version drift analyzed and consolidated where possible
- [ ] Lockfiles regenerated safely with dependency changes
- [ ] Build processes validated to work with cleaned dependencies
- [ ] Development and production builds both functional
- [ ] Package.json files cleaned and organized consistently
- [ ] Workspace dependency relationships optimized
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed through updates
- [ ] Bundle size reduction measured and documented

## Technical Details
- Use depcheck reports to identify truly unused dependencies
- Cross-reference with dynamic imports and runtime requires
- Handle monorepo workspace dependencies properly
- Check for:
  - Direct dependencies not imported anywhere
  - devDependencies used in production code
  - Missing peerDependencies causing warnings
  - Version inconsistencies across workspace packages
- Regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml safely with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false`
- Run builds after each dependency removal batch
- Create rollback package.json files before changes
- Test both development and production build scenarios

## Dependencies
- [ ] Analysis infrastructure (001) providing depcheck reports
- [ ] Understanding of workspace dependency relationships
- [ ] Current build process working and validated
- [ ] Team knowledge of critical runtime dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-10 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All truly unused dependencies removed with verification
- [ ] Missing peerDependencies properly added
- [ ] Version drift resolved across workspace packages
- [ ] Lockfiles regenerated and committed safely
- [ ] Development server starts without dependency errors
- [ ] Production build completes successfully
- [ ] TypeScript compilation works with cleaned dependencies
- [ ] Test suite passes with dependency changes
- [ ] Security audit shows no new vulnerabilities
- [ ] Bundle size reduction documented and measured
- [ ] Package.json files follow consistent formatting
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
