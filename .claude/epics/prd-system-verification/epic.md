# Epic: System Verification Framework

## Overview

Implement comprehensive system verification that validates all cidery management pages and workflows function correctly in production. This builds on our existing 826-test infrastructure to add end-to-end UI verification, ensuring operators can complete the golden path workflow (Purchase → Press → Batch → Transfer → Packaging → COGS Report) without errors.

The focus is on practical production confidence: every page loads, demo data is visible, role permissions work, and the complete business workflow executes successfully through the UI.

## Architecture Decisions

- **E2E Testing Framework**: Playwright for comprehensive browser-based testing with Next.js integration
- **Verification Strategy**: Extend existing Vitest workspace with new E2E package for browser automation
- **Demo Data Approach**: Leverage existing seed data with verification scripts to confirm UI visibility
- **CI Integration**: Extend current GitHub Actions workflow with pre-deployment verification gates
- **Page Discovery**: Automated page crawling using Next.js App Router file system for comprehensive coverage
- **Role Testing**: Utilize existing Auth.js and RBAC system for permission verification

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Page Verification Service**: Automated discovery and testing of all Next.js pages
- **Demo Data Validation**: Scripts to verify seed data visibility through UI components
- **Role Testing Utilities**: Automated login and permission testing for Admin/Operator roles
- **Golden Path Automation**: Browser automation for complete production workflow

### Backend Services
- **Health Check API**: Simple tRPC endpoints for system status verification
- **Seed Data Validation**: Database queries to verify demo data completeness
- **Audit Coverage Verification**: Scripts to ensure 100% mutation logging
- **Migration Verification**: Automated database state validation after migrations

### Infrastructure
- **Playwright Test Environment**: Browser automation infrastructure with test database isolation
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow extensions for pre-deployment verification
- **Verification Dashboard**: Simple status page showing verification results
- **Alert Integration**: Basic notification system for verification failures

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **E2E Infrastructure Setup** (Week 1): Playwright configuration, test database, CI integration
2. **Page & Role Verification** (Week 2): Automated page testing, role-based access validation
3. **Golden Path Automation** (Week 3): End-to-end workflow testing through UI
4. **Production Integration** (Week 4): Pre-deployment gates, monitoring, documentation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Build on established Vitest workspace and CI pipeline
- **Simple Implementation**: Focus on core verification needs without complex monitoring
- **Incremental Rollout**: Start with basic page verification, add workflow testing progressively
- **Fallback Strategy**: Manual verification checklists if automated verification fails

### Testing Approach
- **Test the Tests**: Meta-testing to ensure verification scripts work correctly
- **Browser Matrix**: Test on primary browser targets (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure verification overhead doesn't impact development velocity
- **False Positive Prevention**: Robust selectors and retry logic to minimize flaky tests

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Playwright Framework**: Browser automation for E2E testing
- **Existing Database Schema**: Stable schema for migration and data verification
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated verification
- **Next.js App Router**: File system routing for page discovery

### Internal Dependencies
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Builds on existing Vitest workspace (Epic: prd-testing-audit)
- **Seed Data System**: Requires comprehensive demo data for verification
- **Auth.js Integration**: User authentication and role-based access system
- **Audit Logging**: Verification of 100% mutation coverage
- **tRPC API Layer**: Health check endpoints and data validation

### Team Dependencies
- **Frontend Pages**: All major pages must be implemented (Vendors, Pressing, Cellar, etc.)
- **Authentication System**: Role-based access control must be functional
- **Database Seeding**: Comprehensive demo data for realistic testing
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Stable CI/CD process for integration

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Page & UI Verification
- **100% Page Load Success**: All defined pages (Vendors, Pressing, Cellar, Packaging, Inventory, Reports, Admin) load successfully
- **UI Response Performance**: All pages load within 3 seconds under test conditions
- **Navigation Verification**: Inter-page navigation functions correctly

### Workflow Verification
- **Golden Path Completion**: Purchase → Press → Batch → Transfer → Packaging → COGS Report completes without manual database edits
- **Workflow Performance**: Complete golden path executes within 10 minutes
- **Data Flow Validation**: Each workflow step correctly updates subsequent stages

### Data & Security Verification
- **Demo Data Visibility**: ≥95% of seeded demo data visible and functional through UI
- **Role Permission Enforcement**: 100% of Admin/Operator restrictions work correctly
- **Audit Coverage**: 0 unlogged mutations (100% audit trail coverage)

### System Integration
- **CI Integration**: Pre-deployment verification passes before production releases
- **Error Detection**: Verification system identifies issues with <1% false positive rate
- **Recovery Capability**: System recovers from verification failures within 60 seconds

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
- **4 weeks** for complete implementation with full verification coverage
- **MVP in 2 weeks** covering basic page verification and golden path testing

### Resource Requirements
- **1 senior developer** with E2E testing experience
- **Part-time support** from frontend developer for page inventory and UI validation

### Critical Path Items
1. **Week 1**: E2E infrastructure setup (Playwright, test database, CI integration)
2. **Week 2**: Page verification and role testing implementation
3. **Week 3**: Golden path workflow automation and validation
4. **Week 4**: Production integration, monitoring, and documentation

### Risk Factors
- **Page Implementation Dependencies**: Verification can only test pages that exist
- **Seed Data Completeness**: Demo data must be comprehensive for meaningful testing
- **CI Pipeline Stability**: Integration depends on reliable deployment pipeline
- **Browser Compatibility**: E2E tests must be stable across different environments

This system verification framework provides production confidence through comprehensive UI and workflow validation while building pragmatically on existing infrastructure and minimizing implementation complexity.
