# Task: Packaging Index Page

## Description
Create the packaging runs index view that shows a list of all packaging runs with filtering, sorting, and search capabilities. This is the default view when navigating to `/packaging` without a specific runId.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Table displays all packaging runs
- [ ] Columns: Date, Batch, Package Type, Units, Status
- [ ] Date range filter functional
- [ ] Batch filter with autocomplete
- [ ] Package type filter dropdown
- [ ] Sorting by date, batch name, units
- [ ] Click row to view run details
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets

## Technical Details
- Extend: `apps/web/src/app/packaging/page.tsx`
- Create PackagingRunsTable component
- Reuse existing table patterns from inventory
- Use tRPC query with filters
- Implement client-side sorting where appropriate
- Add loading and empty states
- Default sort: Date descending

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: API list endpoint required
- [ ] Task 004: Shares same page file

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4 hours
- Parallel: false (needs API, conflicts with run view)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Table component renders all runs
- [ ] Filters working correctly
- [ ] Sorting functional
- [ ] Pagination implemented
- [ ] Click-through to detail view
- [ ] Performance acceptable for 1000+ rows
