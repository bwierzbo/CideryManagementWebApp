# Task 008: Offline Capability & Resume

## Description

Implement offline capability for the pressing workflow to handle connectivity issues common in cidery production environments. This includes local storage persistence for draft press runs, background synchronization when connectivity is restored, and the ability to resume interrupted press runs. Additionally, implement Service Worker functionality to enable progressive web app features and optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution.

The solution should leverage existing patterns from the mobile-optimized purchasing system and follow the established state management architecture using React Hook Form and TanStack Query.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Local Storage Persistence
- [ ] Press run drafts automatically saved to local storage every 30 seconds
- [ ] Fruit load entries persisted immediately on input completion
- [ ] Draft press runs viewable and resumable after browser restart
- [ ] Local storage cleanup after successful server sync (retain for 48 hours)
- [ ] Storage quota management with user notification when approaching limits

### Background Synchronization
- [ ] Automatic sync when connectivity restored (detected via online/offline events)
- [ ] Manual sync trigger available in UI for user control
- [ ] Conflict resolution when local and server data diverge
- [ ] Progress indicator during sync operations
- [ ] Error handling with retry logic for failed sync attempts

### Resume Functionality
- [ ] List of resumable press runs available on main pressing page
- [ ] Press run state completely restored including all fruit loads
- [ ] Seamless continuation from last completed step
- [ ] Clear visual indication of resumed vs new press runs
- [ ] Ability to discard local drafts if no longer needed

### Service Worker Features
- [ ] Basic Service Worker installed for PWA capability
- [ ] Cache critical resources (HTML, CSS, JS) for offline access
- [ ] Network-first strategy for API calls with fallback to cache
- [ ] Background sync registration for pending uploads
- [ ] Push notification capability (foundation for future features)

### Optimistic UI Updates
- [ ] Fruit loads appear immediately when added (before server confirmation)
- [ ] Loading states and error handling for optimistic updates
- [ ] Rollback mechanism when server operations fail
- [ ] Visual feedback distinguishing confirmed vs pending operations
- [ ] Batch operations for multiple pending changes

## Technical Details

### Local Storage Schema
```typescript
interface PressRunDraft {
  id: string;
  vendorId: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'syncing' | 'synced';
  startTime: string;
  loads: PressRunLoadDraft[];
  lastModified: string;
  syncAttempts: number;
}

interface PressRunLoadDraft {
  id: string;
  purchaseLineId: string;
  appleVarietyId: string;
  weightKg: number;
  weightUnitEntered: 'lbs' | 'kg';
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'error';
}
```

### Service Worker Implementation
- Register service worker with proper scope for pressing routes
- Implement cache strategies using Workbox patterns
- Background sync for offline-created press runs
- Network connectivity detection and status updates
- Resource versioning for cache invalidation

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
- Server timestamp comparison for detecting conflicts
- User prompt for manual conflict resolution when automatic merge impossible
- Preserve all conflicting data with clear labeling
- Audit log entries for conflict resolution decisions
- Graceful degradation when conflicts cannot be resolved

### State Management Extensions
- Extend existing tRPC mutations with optimistic updates
- Local storage middleware for React Hook Form persistence
- Custom hooks for draft management and sync status
- Integration with existing mobile UI patterns

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite Tasks:**
- Task 005: Mobile UI Components (responsive layout foundation)
- Task 006: Purchase Integration (inventory validation needed for offline validation)
- Task 007: Unit Conversions (weight conversion utilities for local calculations)

**External Dependencies:**
- Existing TanStack Query configuration for cache management
- Current mobile UI patterns from purchasing page
- Established tRPC mutation patterns for optimistic updates
- Browser API compatibility (Service Worker, Local Storage, Network status)

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Service Worker browser support (target: iOS Safari 11.1+, Android Chrome 50+)
- Local Storage quota availability (estimate 5MB minimum needed)
- Network connectivity detection APIs
- Background sync capability for supported browsers

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort: 2 weeks (80 hours)**

### Week 1: Foundation & Local Storage (40 hours)
- Local storage persistence layer: 12 hours
- Draft press run management: 10 hours
- Resume functionality implementation: 10 hours
- Unit testing for offline features: 8 hours

### Week 2: Service Worker & Sync (40 hours)
- Service Worker setup and caching: 15 hours
- Background synchronization logic: 12 hours
- Conflict resolution implementation: 8 hours
- Integration testing and mobile device testing: 5 hours

### Risk Factors
- **High**: Service Worker compatibility across iOS/Android browsers
- **Medium**: Local storage quota limitations on older devices
- **Medium**: Conflict resolution complexity with concurrent edits
- **Low**: Performance impact of local storage operations

## Definition of Done
