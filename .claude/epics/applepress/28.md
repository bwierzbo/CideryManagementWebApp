# Task 009: Testing & Quality Assurance

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing strategy for the ApplePress pressing workflow system. This includes unit tests for press run business logic, integration tests for API endpoints, mobile device testing across iOS Safari and Android Chrome, end-to-end workflow testing, and performance testing for concurrent operations during peak harvest season.

The testing approach should follow established patterns from the existing cidery management system while addressing the unique requirements of mobile-first pressing operations, offline capability, and real-time inventory validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Unit Testing Coverage
- [ ] 95%+ code coverage for all press run business logic functions
- [ ] Complete test suite for unit conversion utilities (lbs/kg, L/gal)
- [ ] Validation logic testing for purchase line inventory constraints
- [ ] Weight and yield calculation accuracy tests
- [ ] Local storage persistence and retrieval functionality tests
- [ ] Conflict resolution logic for offline synchronization

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Full tRPC API endpoint testing with real database operations
- [ ] Purchase line integration with proper inventory deduction
- [ ] Vessel assignment workflow with capacity validation
- [ ] Audit logging integration for all press run activities
- [ ] Authentication and authorization testing for pressing permissions
- [ ] Database transaction integrity during press run operations

### Mobile Device Testing
- [ ] iOS Safari testing (versions 14, 15, 16+) on iPhone and iPad
- [ ] Android Chrome testing (versions 90+) on phone and tablet
- [ ] Touch interaction testing for all UI components
- [ ] Responsive design validation across screen sizes (320px - 1024px)
- [ ] Offline functionality testing on actual mobile devices
- [ ] Service Worker installation and cache behavior verification

### End-to-End Workflow Testing
- [ ] Complete press run creation through completion workflow
- [ ] Multi-load press run with different apple varieties
- [ ] Resume interrupted press run functionality
- [ ] Offline-to-online synchronization with conflict resolution
- [ ] Purchase line inventory validation during pressing
- [ ] Juice volume recording and vessel assignment completion

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Support 50+ concurrent active press runs during peak operations
- [ ] Sub-second response time for fruit load additions
- [ ] Mobile page load time under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- [ ] Local storage operations under 100ms for typical operations
- [ ] Database query performance under load (500+ concurrent operations)
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring for long-running press sessions

## Technical Details

### Test Infrastructure Setup
```typescript
// Example test configuration
describe('PressRunService', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Real database setup with test isolation
    await seedTestDatabase();
    await createTestVendor();
    await createTestPurchaseLines();
  });

  afterEach(async () => {
    await cleanupTestDatabase();
  });
});
```

### Testing Tools and Frameworks
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest for fast test execution with TypeScript support
- **Integration Testing**: Real PostgreSQL database with transaction rollback
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for cross-browser automation
- **Mobile Testing**: BrowserStack or similar service for device matrix
- **Performance Testing**: Artillery.js for load testing API endpoints
- **Visual Regression**: Percy or Chromatic for UI consistency

### Test Data Management
- Comprehensive test fixtures for all apple varieties and purchase scenarios
- Realistic press run test data covering edge cases and typical workflows
- Mock data generators for stress testing scenarios
- Test database seeding with referential integrity
- Cleanup strategies to prevent test data pollution

### Mobile Testing Matrix
```
Device Coverage:
- iPhone SE (375px width)
- iPhone 12/13/14 (390px width)
- iPhone 12/13/14 Plus (428px width)
- iPad (768px width)
- Samsung Galaxy S21 (360px width)
- Samsung Galaxy Tab (800px width)

Browser Coverage:
- iOS Safari 14.0+ (webkit engine)
- Android Chrome 90+ (blink engine)
- Progressive Web App installation testing
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- API response times: 95th percentile under 500ms
- Mobile page load: First Contentful Paint under 2 seconds
- Offline storage operations: 99th percentile under 200ms
- Concurrent user support: 50 active press runs with no degradation
- Memory usage: Under 100MB for 8-hour pressing session

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite Tasks (All Previous Tasks):**
- Task 001: Database Schema (data layer for testing)
- Task 002: tRPC API Layer (endpoints to test)
- Task 003: Mobile UI Components (UI components to test)
- Task 004: Purchase Integration (inventory validation to test)
- Task 005-007: Additional core functionality
- Task 008: Offline Capability (offline features to test)

**External Dependencies:**
- Test database environment with proper isolation
- Mobile device testing infrastructure (BrowserStack, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution
