# Task: Mobile Pressing Page

## Description

Create the main `/pressing` route with a mobile-first responsive layout optimized for touch interactions. This page serves as the entry point for the pressing workflow, featuring large touch targets and progressive navigation patterns that follow established mobile optimization from the purchasing page.

The pressing page provides operators with an intuitive mobile interface to initiate press runs, view active/resumable runs, and navigate through the pressing workflow steps. The design prioritizes usability on mobile devices while maintaining desktop compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/pressing` route created with Next.js App Router structure
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design with viewport breakpoints matching existing patterns
- [ ] Large touch targets (minimum 44px) for all interactive elements
- [ ] Progressive pressing workflow with clear step navigation indicators
- [ ] "Start New Press Run" primary action button prominently displayed
- [ ] List of resumable press runs (in_progress status) with continuation options
- [ ] Recent completed press runs summary for quick reference
- [ ] Consistent styling with existing cidery management app theme
- [ ] Loading states and error boundaries for robust user experience
- [ ] Offline capability with appropriate messaging when no connection

## Technical Details

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Create `app/pressing/page.tsx` following App Router conventions
- Implement responsive CSS Grid layout using Tailwind classes
- Use React Hook Form for any form interactions
- Integrate with existing authentication/authorization patterns
- Leverage existing mobile optimization CSS classes from purchasing page

**Component Structure:**
```typescript
// Main page component
PressingPage
├── PressRunHeader (vendor selection, date display)
├── ActiveRunsSection (resumable press runs)
├── CompletedRunsSection (recent history)
└── ActionButtons (start new run, view all runs)
```

**Mobile Optimization Patterns:**
- Touch-friendly card layouts with adequate spacing
- Bottom-aligned primary actions for thumb accessibility
- Swipe gestures for navigation between sections
- Sticky header with essential context information
- Pull-to-refresh functionality for data synchronization

**State Management:**
- Use TanStack Query for server state (press runs list)
- Local state for UI interactions and navigation
- Optimistic updates for immediate user feedback

## Dependencies

- Next.js App Router structure already established
- Existing mobile CSS patterns from purchasing page
- Authentication/authorization middleware already available
- Tailwind CSS configuration and theme tokens

## Effort Estimate

**2-3 days**
- Page structure and routing: 4 hours
- Mobile responsive layout implementation: 8 hours
- Integration with existing patterns: 4 hours
- Testing and refinement: 4 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Page renders correctly on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines (44px minimum)
- [ ] Navigation flows smoothly between sections
- [ ] Consistent with existing app styling and patterns
- [ ] Loading states provide appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Code follows established project conventions and patterns
- [ ] Responsive design works across all supported breakpoints
- [ ] Performance meets mobile optimization standards (sub-3s load time)
- [ ] Integration tests verify core functionality
