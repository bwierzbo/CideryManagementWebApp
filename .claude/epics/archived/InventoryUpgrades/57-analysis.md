# Issue #57 Analysis: Table Sorting & Search

## Overview
Implement comprehensive column sorting functionality and optimize real-time search performance for the enhanced inventory table created in Issue #56.

## Work Stream Breakdown

### Stream A: Column Sorting Implementation
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Dependencies**: None (builds on Issue #56)
**Can Start**: Immediately
**Files**:
- `apps/web/src/components/inventory/InventoryTable.tsx` (update)
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useTableSorting.ts` (new)
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/sortable-header.tsx` (new)

**Scope**: Implement column sorting with visual indicators, sort state management, and multi-column sorting support.

### Stream B: Search Performance Optimization
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Dependencies**: Stream A (for sort integration)
**Can Start**: After Stream A
**Files**:
- `apps/web/src/components/inventory/InventorySearch.tsx` (update)
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useOptimizedSearch.ts` (new)
- `apps/web/src/utils/searchUtils.ts` (new)

**Scope**: Optimize search performance, implement advanced search features, and ensure <300ms response time.

### Stream C: Integration and Performance Testing
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B
**Can Start**: After Streams A & B
**Files**:
- `apps/web/src/app/inventory/page.tsx` (update)
- Performance testing and optimization
- Accessibility improvements

**Scope**: Integrate sorting and search optimizations, test performance with large datasets, and ensure accessibility compliance.

## Technical Considerations

### Sorting Requirements
- All columns sortable: Name, Type, Quantity, Location, Date
- Visual indicators (up/down arrows) for sort direction
- Three-way sorting: ascending → descending → none
- Preserve sort state during filtering
- Multi-column sorting support
- Keyboard navigation support

### Search Performance
- Real-time search with <300ms response time
- Debounced input with optimized debounce timing
- Efficient search algorithms for large datasets
- Search result highlighting
- Search history and suggestions

### State Management
- Unified state for sorting and search
- URL parameter synchronization
- Persistent user preferences
- Clean state transitions

## Performance Targets
- Search response: <300ms for 1000+ items
- Sorting response: <100ms for any column
- Memory usage: Efficient for large datasets
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Building on completed Issue #56 infrastructure
- **Medium Risk**: Performance optimization complexity
- **Mitigation**: Incremental performance testing and optimization

## Success Metrics
- All columns sortable in both directions
- Search responds within 300ms consistently
- Sort state persists during all operations
- Accessibility compliance maintained
- Performance targets met under load
