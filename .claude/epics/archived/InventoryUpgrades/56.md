# Task: Enhanced Inventory Table - Add type column, search box, and filter buttons

## Description
Enhance the inventory table to include material type information, search functionality, and filtering capabilities. This task will unify the display of different inventory types (fresh fruit, cider, packaged products) in a single, searchable table with clear visual indicators.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add type column to inventory table showing material type
- [ ] Add search input field above the table
- [ ] Add filter buttons for material types (Fresh Fruit, Cider, Packaged)
- [ ] Add visual indicators (icons/colors) for different types
- [ ] Update inventory page to display unified table
- [ ] Maintain existing pagination functionality
- [ ] Ensure responsive design on mobile devices

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Extend existing inventory table component
- Files affected:
  - `/apps/web/src/app/inventory/page.tsx` - Main inventory page
  - `/apps/web/src/components/inventory/` - Inventory table components
  - Potential new components for search and filter UI
- Use the unified inventory API endpoint from task 006
- Implement client-side filtering and search with debouncing
- Add TypeScript types for filter states and search parameters

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 006 (Unified Inventory API) must be completed
- [ ] API endpoint `/api/inventory/unified` must be available
- [ ] Material type data must be included in API response

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and follows existing patterns
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Search functionality works with <300ms response time
- [ ] Filter buttons correctly filter table data
- [ ] Visual indicators clearly distinguish material types
