# Issue #55: Transaction Handlers & Business Logic - Stream B Progress

## Work Completed

### 1. Created Comprehensive Inventory Service Layer
- **File**: `packages/api/src/services/inventory.ts`
- **Implemented complete business logic** for all transaction types with material-specific validation
- **Type-safe operations** with comprehensive error handling and foreign key validation
- **Database transaction safety** ensuring atomicity across all operations
- **Service-oriented architecture** for reusable inventory operations

### 2. Material-Specific Transaction Validation
- **Apple transactions**: Full validation including vendor-variety relationships, quality grades, harvest dates, defect percentages, and brix levels
- **Additive transactions**: Type/name validation, expiration date checks, concentration tracking, and storage requirements
- **Juice transactions**: Volume validation, pH/brix level checks, variety composition validation (must sum to 100%), and press run/vessel references
- **Packaging transactions**: Type/name validation, quantity/unit verification, size/color/material tracking

### 3. Advanced Inventory Management Features
- **Stock level monitoring** with configurable thresholds and low stock detection
- **Inventory reservation system** for upcoming operations with proper availability checks
- **Bulk transfer operations** for location changes with full audit trails
- **Transaction summary reporting** with date range filtering and aggregation by transaction type
- **Comprehensive foreign key validation** ensuring data integrity across all related entities

### 4. Database Transaction Atomicity
- **Proper transaction handling** with rollback on errors across all service methods
- **Inventory level validation** preventing negative stock and reserved stock violations
- **Concurrent operation safety** with proper database locks where needed
- **Error recovery** with detailed error messages and proper TRPCError codes

### 5. Extended Inventory Router with Service Integration
- **File**: `packages/api/src/routers/inventory.ts` (enhanced existing)
- **Service layer integration** replacing inline business logic with reusable service methods
- **New endpoints**:
  - `createInventoryItem` - Material-specific inventory creation with validation
  - `bulkTransfer` - Bulk location transfers with audit trails
  - `checkStockLevels` - Low stock monitoring and alerts
  - `reserveInventory` - Inventory reservation for planned operations
  - `releaseReservation` - Release reserved inventory back to available stock
  - `getTransactionSummary` - Detailed transaction analysis and reporting
- **Enhanced recordTransaction** - Uses service layer for comprehensive validation

### 6. Comprehensive Error Handling & Validation
- **Material-specific validation** with detailed error messages for each transaction type
- **Foreign key validation** ensuring all referenced entities exist and are valid
- **Business rule enforcement** (e.g., vendor-variety relationships, positive quantities)
- **Graceful error handling** with proper TRPCError codes and user-friendly messages
- **Edge case protection** (negative inventory, reserved stock violations, expired additives)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture
- **Single responsibility** - Each method handles one specific business operation
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript coverage from input validation to database operations
- **Error isolation** - Transactions are properly isolated with rollback on failures
- **Audit logging** - Comprehensive event publishing for all inventory changes
- **Performance optimization** - Efficient database queries with proper indexing considerations

### Database Patterns
- **Atomic transactions** - All multi-step operations wrapped in database transactions
- **Constraint handling** - Proper handling of current schema constraints (packageId requirement)
- **Row locking** - Appropriate use of database locks for inventory level checks
- **Foreign key enforcement** - Validation of all relationships before operations

### Validation Hierarchy
1. **Schema validation** - Zod schema validation for input structure
2. **Business rule validation** - Service layer validation for business logic
3. **Database constraint validation** - Foreign key and data integrity checks
4. **Inventory level validation** - Stock availability and reservation checks

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All assigned work for Stream B has been completed:
- ✅ Comprehensive inventory service layer with complete business logic
- ✅ Detailed transaction handlers for all material types with full validation
- ✅ Advanced inventory level tracking and stock management operations
- ✅ Database transaction atomicity with proper error handling and rollback
- ✅ Extended inventory router with service layer integration
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases and validation scenarios

## Files Modified/Created
- **Created**: `packages/api/src/services/inventory.ts` (847 lines of comprehensive service logic)
- **Enhanced**: `packages/api/src/routers/inventory.ts` (added 7 new endpoints using service layer)
- **Fixed**: `packages/api/src/types/inventory.ts` (resolved TypeScript issues with discriminated unions)
- **Fixed**: `packages/api/src/routers/varieties.ts` (resolved error handling TypeScript issues)

## Integration Points for Other Streams

### Stream A Integration ✅
- **Type definitions**: Uses all types and schemas created in Stream A
- **Router structure**: Built upon the base router structure from Stream A
- **Validation schemas**: Leverages Zod schemas for input validation

### Stream C Integration (Frontend)
- **Type exports**: All service operations return typed responses for frontend consumption
- **Error handling**: Consistent TRPCError responses for frontend error handling
- **API endpoints**: Complete set of inventory management endpoints ready for frontend integration

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Current constraints**: Working within existing schema constraints (packageId requirement)
- **Future improvements**: Identified areas for schema optimization for raw materials
- **Migration readiness**: Service layer designed to adapt to future schema improvements
