# Task 007 Analysis: Testing & Documentation

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Core Service Testing (Primary - 10-12 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `packages/api/src/services/pdf/__tests__/`
- `packages/api/src/services/email/__tests__/`
- `packages/api/src/services/reports/__tests__/`
- `packages/api/src/services/storage/__tests__/`
- `packages/api/src/services/monitoring/__tests__/`

**Work Items:**
- Achieve >95% test coverage on PDF generation services
- Achieve >95% test coverage on email services
- Create unit tests for all PDF template components
- Test concurrent report generation scenarios (5+ simultaneous users)
- Test large dataset handling (500+ purchases)
- Validate memory-efficient streaming for large reports
- Test email delivery success rates (>95% target)
- Create performance benchmarks for SLA validation
- Test graceful error handling with clear user feedback
- Validate professional PDF formatting standards

### Stream B: Integration & End-to-End Testing (Independent - 8-10 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `tests/integration/reports/`
- `tests/e2e/reports/`
- `packages/api/src/routers/__tests__/reports.test.ts`
- `packages/api/src/routers/__tests__/email.test.ts`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/__tests__/`

**Work Items:**
- Create integration tests for complete report generation workflow
- Create end-to-end tests for vendor email delivery
- Test purchase order PDF generation from UI to email delivery
- Test date range report generation with all filtering options
- Validate complete audit trail functionality
- Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Integration testing for background job processing
- Test file storage and cleanup operations
- Validate performance monitoring and alerting
- Cross-browser testing for report generation interface

### Stream C: Documentation & User Guides (Independent - 6-8 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `docs/user/reports/`
- `docs/admin/reports/`
- `docs/troubleshooting/`
- `docs/api/reports.md`
- `README-reports.md`

**Work Items:**
- Create user documentation for report generation interface
- Create admin documentation for system configuration
- Document troubleshooting procedures for email delivery
- Create vendor communication workflow documentation
- Document API endpoints for reports and email services
- Create installation and configuration guides
- Document performance tuning recommendations
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Document security considerations and best practices
- Create training materials for end users

## Coordination Requirements

1. **Stream A must complete core service validation** before Stream B can run comprehensive integration tests
2. **Stream B depends on all Tasks 001-006** implementations being available for integration testing
3. **Stream C can work independently** but should reference test results from Streams A and B
4. **All streams converge** for final quality assurance and deployment validation

## Definition of Done per Stream

### Stream A Complete:

- Unit tests covering all template components and edge cases
- Performance tests validating SLA requirements (<10s single, <30s range, <2min large)
- Concurrent testing with 5+ simultaneous users
- Large dataset testing with 500+ purchase records
- Memory usage validation for streaming PDF generation
- Email delivery success rate validation (>95%)
- Error handling tests with comprehensive coverage

### Stream B Complete:
- Complete workflow integration tests from UI to email delivery
- End-to-end vendor email communication testing
- Purchase order generation workflow validation
- Date range reporting with all filter combinations
