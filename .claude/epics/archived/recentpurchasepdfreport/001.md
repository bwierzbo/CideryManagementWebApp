# Task: PDF Generation Infrastructure - PDFKit setup, template engine, base PDF service

## Description
Establish the core PDF generation infrastructure using PDFKit, creating a template engine and base PDF service that will support both single purchase order reports and date range reporting. This foundational task provides the PDF generation capabilities, template system, and service architecture that all other reporting features will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PDFKit library integrated and configured for Node.js environment
- [ ] Base PDF service class created with core generation methods
- [ ] Template engine developed for flexible PDF layout and content insertion
- [ ] Font management and branding assets integrated (logos, letterhead)
- [ ] Basic PDF styling and formatting utilities implemented
- [ ] Memory-efficient streaming PDF generation for large reports
- [ ] Error handling and validation for PDF generation processes
- [ ] Unit tests covering core PDF generation functionality

## Technical Details
- Install and configure PDFKit in `packages/api` workspace
- Create `PdfGenerationService` in `packages/api/src/services/`
- Implement template engine with JSON-based configuration support
- Set up font loading and cidery branding asset integration
- Create reusable PDF components (headers, footers, tables, styling)
- Implement streaming generation for memory efficiency
- Add TypeScript definitions for template configurations
- Create base classes for different report types (purchase order, date range)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js environment with PDFKit library support
- [ ] Existing tRPC API infrastructure
- [ ] Cidery branding assets (logo, letterhead designs)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper PDF generation service
- [ ] Template engine supports flexible report layouts
- [ ] Branding and styling consistently applied
- [ ] Tests written covering PDF generation scenarios
- [ ] Memory-efficient streaming generation implemented
- [ ] TypeScript types defined for template configurations
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback for generation failures
- [ ] Documentation created for template engine usage
