# Task 006 Analysis: Performance & Caching

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Background Job System (Primary - 10-12 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `packages/worker/src/jobs/`
- `packages/worker/src/jobs/PdfGenerationJob.ts`
- `packages/worker/src/jobs/JobQueue.ts`
- `packages/worker/src/jobs/types.ts`
- `packages/db/src/schema/jobs.ts`

**Work Items:**
- Design job queue system with Redis or database-backed queue
- Create PdfGenerationJob with progress tracking and status updates
- Implement job retry logic and error handling
- Add job queue management (priority, concurrency limits)
- Create job status API endpoints for real-time progress
- Database schema for job tracking and metadata

### Stream B: File Storage & Caching (Independent - 8-10 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `packages/api/src/services/storage/`
- `packages/api/src/services/storage/FileStorageService.ts`
- `packages/api/src/services/cache/`
- `packages/api/src/services/cache/ReportCacheService.ts`
- `packages/db/src/schema/files.ts`

**Work Items:**
- Implement file storage system (local filesystem or cloud storage)
- Create report cache with TTL (24-48 hour retention)
- Add file cleanup service for expired reports
- Implement cache invalidation strategies
- Database schema for file metadata and cache tracking
- Add storage quota management and monitoring

### Stream C: Performance Monitoring (Independent - 6-8 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `packages/api/src/services/monitoring/`
- `packages/api/src/services/monitoring/PerformanceMonitor.ts`
- `packages/api/src/middleware/performance.ts`
- `packages/db/src/schema/performance.ts`

**Work Items:**
- Create performance monitoring service with metrics collection
- Add request timing middleware for API routes
- Implement memory usage tracking for PDF generation
- Create performance benchmarking suite
- Database schema for performance metrics storage
- Add alerting for performance threshold breaches

## Coordination Requirements

1. **Stream A and B must coordinate** on job result storage location
2. **Stream C can work independently** but needs integration points with A and B
3. **All streams need database schema** coordination to avoid conflicts
4. **Integration testing** requires all three streams to be substantially complete

## Definition of Done per Stream

### Stream A Complete:
- JobQueue system with Redis/database backend
- PdfGenerationJob with progress tracking (0-100%)
- Job retry logic with exponential backoff
- Real-time status API with WebSocket support
- Concurrent job processing (5+ simultaneous)
- Job history and cleanup procedures

### Stream B Complete:
- FileStorageService with local/cloud storage support
- ReportCacheService with intelligent TTL management
- Automated cleanup of expired files (24-48 hours)
- Cache hit/miss tracking and optimization
- File metadata database with search capabilities
- Storage quota monitoring and alerts

### Stream C Complete:
- PerformanceMonitor collecting key metrics (generation time, memory usage, file size)
- Request timing middleware integrated into tRPC routers
- Memory profiling for large PDF generation (500+ purchases)
- Benchmarking suite validating SLA requirements (<10s single, <30s range, <2min large)
- Performance dashboard for monitoring trends
- Automated alerts for SLA violations

## Integration Points

- Stream A uses Stream B for storing generated PDF files
- Stream A reports metrics to Stream C monitoring system
- Stream B provides cache statistics to Stream C monitoring
- All streams share database connection and transaction management
- Shared error handling and logging infrastructure
