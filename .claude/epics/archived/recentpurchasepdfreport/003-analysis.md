# Task 003 Analysis: Date Range Reporting System

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Report Template Engine (Core - 8-10 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `packages/api/src/services/reports/`
- `packages/api/src/services/reports/templates/DateRangeTemplate.ts`
- `packages/api/src/services/reports/templates/AccountingTemplate.ts`
- `packages/api/src/services/reports/templates/SummaryTemplate.ts`
- `packages/api/src/services/reports/ReportGenerator.ts`
- `packages/api/src/services/reports/types.ts`

**Work Items:**
- Create DateRangeTemplate with configurable period selection
- Implement AccountingTemplate with detailed cost breakdown
- Build SummaryTemplate with executive overview format
- Develop ReportGenerator with filtering and data aggregation
- Add caching system for frequently requested configurations
- Implement async processing with progress tracking

### Stream B: Backend API & Job Queue (Independent - 6-8 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `packages/api/src/routers/reports.ts`
- `packages/worker/src/jobs/reportGeneration.ts`
- `packages/worker/src/queue/ReportQueue.ts`
- `packages/db/src/schema/reports.ts`
- `packages/api/src/services/reports/ReportJobService.ts`

**Work Items:**
- Create tRPC endpoints: generateDateRange, generateAccounting, generateSummary
- Implement async job queue for large dataset reports (500+ purchases)
- Add report history tracking with metadata storage
- Build progress tracking system with real-time updates
- Create report caching and file storage management
- Add job retry logic and error handling

### Stream C: Frontend Components & Interface (Independent - 6-8 hours)
**File Patterns:**
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/DateRangePicker.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportFilters.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/ProgressIndicator.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportPreview.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/reports/date-range/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/reports/ReportHistory.tsx`

**Work Items:**
- Create DateRangePicker with calendar integration and presets (7/30 days)
- Build ReportFilters for vendor, variety, cost threshold selection
- Implement ProgressIndicator with real-time status updates
- Develop ReportPreview with PDF viewer component
- Add ReportHistory with re-download capabilities
- Create responsive configuration interface with form validation

## Coordination Requirements

1. **Stream A must establish template interfaces** before Stream B can implement job processing
2. **Stream B provides API contracts** that Stream C will consume for real-time updates
3. **Stream C can mock API calls** during development, integrating with Stream B later
4. **All streams depend on Task 001** PDF infrastructure being completed
5. **Final integration** requires coordinated testing of async flows

## Definition of Done per Stream

### Stream A Complete:
- DateRangeTemplate with configurable period filtering
- AccountingTemplate with detailed cost analysis and COGS breakdown
- SummaryTemplate with executive metrics and trends
- ReportGenerator with vendor/variety/cost filtering capabilities
- Template validation and error handling
- Caching system for template configurations

### Stream B Complete:
- tRPC endpoints with proper input validation and error handling
- Async job queue with progress tracking and retry logic
- Report history storage with metadata and file management
- Real-time progress updates via WebSocket or polling
- Job scheduling and large dataset handling (500+ purchases)
- File storage integration with cleanup policies

### Stream C Complete:
- DateRangePicker with intuitive presets and custom range selection
- ReportFilters with multi-select capabilities and search functionality
- ProgressIndicator with real-time updates and cancellation support
- ReportPreview with PDF viewer and download functionality
- ReportHistory with filterable list and re-download capabilities
- Responsive design with proper loading states and error handling

## Integration Points

- Stream A provides template processing capabilities to Stream B job queue
- Stream B exposes tRPC API consumed by Stream C frontend components
- Stream C sends configuration to Stream B which processes via Stream A templates
- All streams utilize shared TypeScript types for configuration objects
- Progress tracking flows from Stream B job queue to Stream C UI components
- Report caching in Stream B reduces load on Stream A template processing
