# Performance & Caching

## Description
Async processing, file storage, and optimization for PDF report generation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement async processing for large reports (>100 purchases)
- [ ] Add file storage system for generated PDFs (24-48 hour retention)
- [ ] Create report generation progress tracking with real-time status
- [ ] Implement memory-efficient streaming PDF generation
- [ ] Add concurrent report generation support (5+ simultaneous users)
- [ ] Create report history database tracking with metadata
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for frequently requested date ranges
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and benchmarking
- [ ] Ensure single purchase order PDF generation <10 seconds
- [ ] Ensure date range reports (50-100 purchases) <30 seconds
- [ ] Ensure large reports (500+ purchases) <2 minutes with async processing

## Technical Details
Background job processing, file storage infrastructure, streaming PDF generation, concurrent processing support, database caching strategies

## Dependencies
001 (PDF Generation Infrastructure), 002 (Single Purchase Order Reports), 003 (Date Range Reporting System)

## Effort
Medium (M), 12-14 hours, parallel: false (integration task)
