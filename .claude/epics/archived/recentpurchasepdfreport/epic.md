# Epic: Recent Purchase PDF Report

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive PDF report generation system for both individual purchase order confirmations (vendor communication) and configurable date range reports (internal analysis). The system leverages the existing robust purchase management infrastructure, vendor data, and tRPC API patterns to provide professional PDF reports with integrated email delivery capabilities.

## Architecture Decisions

### PDF Generation Library
- **Choice**: PDFKit for Node.js
- **Rationale**: Programmatic PDF creation, excellent table support, customizable styling, smaller bundle size than Puppeteer
- **Alternative Considered**: Puppeteer (rejected due to complexity and resource requirements)

### Email Service Integration
- **Choice**: Extend existing email infrastructure (likely using Nodemailer or similar)
- **Rationale**: Minimize dependencies, reuse existing authentication and delivery patterns
- **Features**: Template-based composition, delivery tracking, retry mechanisms

### Data Access Pattern
- **Choice**: Extend existing tRPC router pattern with new `reports` router
- **Rationale**: Maintains consistency with established API patterns, leverages existing RBAC and audit logging
- **Integration**: Direct integration with existing `purchase` router for data retrieval

### Template System
- **Choice**: JSON-based report configuration with code-based PDF templates
- **Rationale**: Flexibility for different report types, easy customization, maintainable template structure
- **Templates**: Single purchase order, date range summary, detailed accounting report

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

#### Report Configuration Interface
- **ReportGeneratorPage**: Main report dashboard with report type selection
- **DateRangePicker**: Calendar-based date selection with presets (7 days, 30 days, custom)
- **ReportFilters**: Vendor selection, apple variety filtering, cost thresholds
- **ReportPreview**: PDF preview component with download/email options
- **ProgressIndicator**: Real-time generation status for large reports

#### Single Purchase Order Integration
- **PurchaseOrderActions**: Integrated into existing purchase management UI
- **VendorEmailModal**: Email composition with template selection and delivery tracking
- **One-click generation**: Direct PDF creation from purchase detail views

### Backend Services

#### New tRPC Router: `reports`
```typescript
export const reportsRouter = router({
  // Single purchase order reports
  generatePurchaseOrder: // Individual purchase PDF with vendor communication
  emailPurchaseOrder: // Send purchase order PDF to vendor

  // Date range reports
  generateDateRange: // Configurable period reports
  generateAccounting: // Detailed accounting format
  generateSummary: // Executive summary format

  // Report management
  getHistory: // Report generation history
  downloadPrevious: // Re-download existing reports
  getTemplates: // Available report templates
})
```

#### PDF Generation Service
- **ReportGenerator**: Core PDF creation engine with template support
- **PurchaseOrderTemplate**: Single purchase order formatting (invoice-style)
- **DateRangeTemplate**: Multi-purchase summary with vendor grouping
- **AccountingTemplate**: Detailed line-item reporting for reconciliation
- **BrandingService**: Cidery logo, letterhead, and contact information injection

#### Email Integration Service
- **VendorEmailService**: Template-based email composition for purchase orders
- **ReportEmailService**: Internal report sharing via email
- **DeliveryTracker**: Email delivery status monitoring and retry logic
- **TemplateEngine**: Customizable email templates with purchase order context

### Infrastructure

#### Report Storage & Caching
- **File Storage**: Generated PDFs stored temporarily for re-download (24-48 hours)
- **Report History**: Database tracking of all generated reports with metadata
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently requested date range configurations

#### Performance Optimization
- **Async Processing**: Background report generation for large datasets (>100 purchases)
- **Streaming PDF**: Memory-efficient PDF generation for large reports
- **Concurrent Generation**: Support multiple simultaneous report requests
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates for long-running reports

#### Integration Points
- **Existing Purchase API**: Direct data access via established purchase router
- **Vendor Management**: Integration with vendor contact information and email addresses
- **User Authentication**: RBAC enforcement for report access and vendor communication
- **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of all report generation and email activities

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core PDF Generation (Week 1-2)
- Set up PDFKit integration and basic PDF templates
- Implement single purchase order PDF generation
- Create report configuration interface
- Basic date range report functionality

### Phase 2: Email Integration & Vendor Communication (Week 3-4)
- Implement vendor email service with template system
- Add email delivery tracking and retry mechanisms
- Integrate purchase order email sending into existing UI
- Complete vendor communication workflow

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Optimization (Week 5-6)
- Add report customization and filtering options
- Implement async processing for large reports
- Complete accounting report templates
- Performance optimization and caching
- Comprehensive testing and deployment

### Risk Mitigation
- **PDF Generation Performance**: Implement streaming and async processing early
- **Email Delivery Reliability**: Build robust retry mechanisms and fallback options
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Test with realistic data volumes and implement pagination
- **Template Complexity**: Start with simple templates and iterate based on user feedback
