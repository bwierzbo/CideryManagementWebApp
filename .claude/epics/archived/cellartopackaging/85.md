# Task: Integration Testing

## Description
Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing for the complete cellar-to-packaging workflow. This includes testing the entire flow from vessel bottling through packaging run management, with extensive coverage of edge cases, error scenarios, concurrent operations, and data integrity validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] End-to-end test suite covering complete bottling workflow
- [ ] Test cellar modal bottling operation with various vessel states
- [ ] Test packaging run creation with all field combinations
- [ ] Test packaging list page filtering, sorting, and pagination
- [ ] Test packaging detail page display and QA updates
- [ ] Test export functionality (CSV/PDF) with various data sets
- [ ] Edge case testing: empty vessels, invalid volumes, missing batches
- [ ] Error scenario testing: database failures, validation errors, network issues
- [ ] Concurrent operation testing: multiple bottling operations simultaneously
- [ ] Data integrity validation: vessel volume updates, inventory creation
- [ ] Permission testing: role-based access to bottling and QA updates
- [ ] Performance testing: large dataset handling, export timeouts
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing for all packaging interfaces
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Load testing for packaging operations under concurrent usage
- [ ] Rollback testing: verify proper cleanup on operation failures

## Technical Details
- Create comprehensive test suite using existing testing framework
- Implement database seeding for consistent test data scenarios
- Use real database connections (no mocks) for integration accuracy
- Test all tRPC API endpoints with various input combinations
- Validate UI state changes through complete user workflows
- Test error boundaries and fallback UI states
- Implement test helpers for common setup/teardown operations
- Create test data factories for vessels, batches, and packaging runs
- Test audit logging accuracy for all operations
- Validate proper cleanup of database connections and resources
- Test background job processing for exports and email delivery
- Include performance benchmarks and regression testing
- Test data migration scenarios and schema evolution

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 78 (Database Schema) completed for full data model
- [ ] Task 79 (Package Sizes Reference) completed for dropdown testing
- [ ] Task 80 (Packaging API Router) completed for API testing
- [ ] Task 81 (Cellar Modal UI) completed for modal workflow testing
- [ ] Task 82 (Packaging List View) completed for list page testing
- [ ] Task 83 (Packaging Detail View) completed for detail page testing
- [ ] Task 84 (QA & Export) completed for QA and export testing
- [ ] Test database environment configured with proper permissions
- [ ] Test data seeding scripts available for consistent scenarios

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 14-16 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all previous tasks completed)

## Definition of Done
