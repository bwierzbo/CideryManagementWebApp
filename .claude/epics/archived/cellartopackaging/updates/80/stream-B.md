# Stream B: Helper Functions and Validation

## Scope
Add helper functions, updateQA mutation, and complete the router integration

## Files
- packages/api/src/routers/packaging.ts (extend with updateQA)
- packages/api/src/routers/index.ts (complete integration)

## Progress
- ✅ Added updateQA mutation to packaging router with full validation and audit logging
- ✅ Removed 334 lines of corrupted/duplicate packaging router code from index.ts
- ✅ Fixed router integration conflicts between Stream A core router and old inline code
- ✅ Verified TypeScript compilation and build success
- ✅ Committed changes with proper audit trail

## Implementation Details

### updateQA Mutation
- Input validation for all QA fields (fillCheck, fillVarianceMl, abvAtPackaging, etc.)
- QA technician validation against users table
- Granular change detection for precise audit logging
- Transaction-safe updates with rollback on failure
- Returns parsed numeric values for consistent API responses

### Code Cleanup
- Identified and removed corrupted packaging router implementation in index.ts
- Preserved clean vessel router and other functionality
- Reduced file size by 334 lines (3291 → 2957 lines)
- Maintained proper packaging router integration via import/export

### Validation
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Build process completed without errors
- Router integration verified through grep analysis
