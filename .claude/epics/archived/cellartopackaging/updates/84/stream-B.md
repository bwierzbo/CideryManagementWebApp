# Stream B Progress Update - Issue #84: CSV Export Implementation

## Completed Work ✅

### 1. Enhanced CSV Export Functionality
- ✅ Added all QA fields to CSV export in `packaging-table.tsx`
- ✅ Included packaging run details: ABV, carbonation level, fill check, test data
- ✅ Added batch information and inventory data
- ✅ Enhanced API to return QA fields in list query
- ✅ Added QA technician name to exports

### 2. Batch Selection Implementation
- ✅ Added checkboxes to table rows in `packaging-table.tsx`
- ✅ Implemented "Select All" functionality in table header
- ✅ Added individual row selection with click handlers
- ✅ Clear selection functionality

### 3. Bulk Export Functionality
- ✅ Added bulk export for selected rows in `packaging/page.tsx`
- ✅ Created bulk actions bar with selection count
- ✅ Export selected items with proper filename generation
- ✅ Clear selection after export capability

### 4. Export Progress Indicators
- ✅ Added loading spinners (Loader2) during export operations
- ✅ Disabled buttons during export to prevent double-clicks
- ✅ Success/error state handling through async/await pattern
- ✅ Visual feedback in both filters and bulk actions

### 5. Filter Integration
- ✅ Export respects all current filters (date, batch search, status, package size)
- ✅ Filter parameters included in generated filenames
- ✅ Format: `packaging-runs-batch-{search}-status-{status}-from-{date}-to-{date}-{timestamp}.csv`

## Files Modified
1. `apps/web/src/components/packaging/packaging-table.tsx` - Enhanced with selection, improved CSV export
2. `apps/web/src/app/packaging/page.tsx` - Added bulk export functionality
3. `apps/web/src/components/packaging/packaging-filters.tsx` - Added export progress indicators

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSV Export Enhancements
- **Headers**: 21 columns including all QA fields and metadata
- **Data**: Proper formatting of dates, numbers, and optional fields
- **Filename**: Dynamic generation with filter context
- **Performance**: Async/await pattern with progress indicators

### Selection Functionality
- **State Management**: `selectedItems` array with callback handlers
- **UI Components**: Checkbox integration with proper accessibility
- **Bulk Actions**: Contextual action bar with item count display
- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback and easy selection management

### Progress Indicators
- **Loading States**: Spinner animations during export operations
- **Button States**: Disabled state during processing
- **Feedback**: Clear visual indication of export progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with proper state cleanup

## Testing Status ✅
- ✅ TypeScript compilation issues resolved for assigned files
- ✅ API endpoint updated to include all required QA fields
- ✅ Interface definitions updated to match API response
- ✅ CSV export functionality verified with enhanced data structure
- ✅ Selection and bulk operations working correctly

## Notes
- Some TypeScript errors remain in files outside this stream's scope (packaging/[id]/page.tsx)
- All requirements from the original task description have been implemented
- Code follows existing patterns and naming conventions
- Ready for integration and end-to-end testing
