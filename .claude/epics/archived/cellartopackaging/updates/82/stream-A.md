# Stream A: Page Structure and Data Table

## Scope
Create main packaging list page with data table

- apps/web/src/components/packaging/packaging-table.tsx (new component)

## Progress
- ✅ Replaced existing packaging page with new list view structure
- ✅ Created PackagingTable component with sortable columns for runs
- ✅ Integrated tRPC packaging.list query with pagination and sorting
- ✅ Added columns for date, batch name, package type/size, units produced, loss %, and status
- ✅ Implemented loading states and empty state with proper icons
- ✅ Added basic pagination controls with Previous/Next buttons
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript types to match API response structure
- ✅ Added click-to-view functionality with navigation to detail pages
- ✅ Successfully built and committed changes

## Implementation Details

### New Page Structure
- Removed complex tabbed interface with forms and inventory views
- Replaced with focused list view for packaging runs
- Added "New Packaging Run" button for future creation functionality
- Clean, professional layout following existing patterns

### Data Table Features
- **Sorting**: Sortable by date, batch name, units produced, and loss percentage
- **Pagination**: Previous/Next controls with page information
- **Columns**: Date, Batch (with vessel), Package Type & Size, Units Produced, Loss %, Status, Actions
- **Loading States**: Skeleton rows during data fetch
- **Empty State**: Helpful message with icon when no data
- **Error Handling**: Error banner for API failures
- **Navigation**: Click rows or View button to navigate to detail pages

### Technical Implementation
- Uses existing `useTableSorting` hook for consistent sorting behavior
- Follows existing table component patterns from inventory tables
- Proper TypeScript typing for API responses
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly controls
- Integrated with tRPC packaging.list query from Task #80
