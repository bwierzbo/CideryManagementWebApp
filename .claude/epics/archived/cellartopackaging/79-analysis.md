# Issue #79: Package Sizes Reference Data - Analysis

## Work Streams

Since the package_sizes table was already created in issue #78, this task focuses solely on seed data implementation.

### Stream A: Seed Data Implementation
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**:
- packages/db/src/seed.ts (main seed orchestrator - check if exists)
- packages/db/src/seed/packageSizes.ts (new file for package sizes seed data)

**Work**:
1. Create seed data module for package sizes
2. Implement idempotent upsert logic
3. Add standard cidery package sizes per PRD
4. Integrate with main seed script

## Dependencies
- Task #78 completed (âœ… package_sizes table exists)

## Coordination Notes
- Single stream task - no coordination needed
- Table already has proper constraints from #78
- Need to follow existing seed patterns in the codebase
