# Issue #83: Packaging Detail View - Analysis

## Work Streams

### Stream A: API Enhancement
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**:
- packages/api/src/routers/packaging.ts (enhance get procedure)

**Work**:
1. Enhance existing get procedure with comprehensive joins
2. Include batch details, vessel info, inventory items
3. Add QA data and measurements
4. Include operator and equipment information
5. Add related inventory items query

### Stream B: Detail Page Implementation
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**:
- apps/web/src/app/packaging/[id]/page.tsx (new detail page)
- apps/web/src/components/packaging/packaging-detail-cards.tsx (new card components)

**Work**:
1. Create dynamic route page following pressing detail pattern
2. Implement production summary card with metrics
3. Create traceability card with batch/vessel history
4. Add QA card with measurements and status
5. Implement inventory items list card
6. Add navigation, loading states, error handling
7. Include print-friendly layout styles

## Dependencies
- Stream B depends on Stream A (needs enhanced API first)
- Both use existing packaging schema from #78
- Both use existing UI patterns from pressing detail pages

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A enhances the API to provide comprehensive data
- Stream B creates the UI following established patterns
- Both work on separate packages (api vs web)
