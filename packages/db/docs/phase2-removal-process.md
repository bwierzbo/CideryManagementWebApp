# Phase 2 Removal Process Documentation

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This document describes the Phase 2 removal process for permanently deleting deprecated database elements. Phase 2 operations are **irreversible** and must only be executed after thorough validation and approval processes.

## Overview

Phase 2 of the database deprecation system involves the permanent removal of database elements that have been deprecated in Phase 1 and confirmed as safe for deletion through monitoring and validation.

**Key Principles:**

- **Irreversible Operations**: Phase 2 operations permanently delete database elements
- **Extensive Validation**: Multi-layer safety checks before any removal
- **Approval Required**: Formal approval process for all removals
- **Backup Mandatory**: Comprehensive backups before any removal operation
- **Monitoring Period**: Minimum observation period after deprecation

## Prerequisites

Before any Phase 2 operation can be executed, the following conditions **MUST** be met:

### 1. Phase 1 Completion

- [ ] Element has been successfully deprecated using Phase 1 system
- [ ] Deprecated element exists with proper naming convention
- [ ] No errors occurred during Phase 1 deprecation
- [ ] Rollback plan is validated and tested

### 2. Cooling-Off Period

- [ ] Minimum 30 days have passed since deprecation
- [ ] Extended to 90 days for production environments
- [ ] No access detected during cooling-off period
- [ ] Monitoring confirms zero usage

### 3. Monitoring Validation

- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring data collected
- [ ] Zero access events recorded
- [ ] No alerts triggered for the element
- [ ] Telemetry analysis confirms safety

### 4. Safety Validations

- [ ] All safety checks pass with high confidence
- [ ] No hidden dependencies discovered
- [ ] Cross-reference analysis complete
- [ ] Impact assessment approved

### 5. Backup Requirements

- [ ] Full database backup created and validated
- [ ] Element-specific backup available
- [ ] Backup restoration tested successfully
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented

### 6. Approval Process

- [ ] Technical review completed
- [ ] Business stakeholder approval obtained
- [ ] Operations team approval received
- [ ] Change management process followed

## Phase 2 Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Removal Assessment

```bash
# 1. Generate removal assessment report
pnpm db:assess-removal --element-id <deprecated_element_id>

# 2. Validate all prerequisites
pnpm db:validate-removal-prerequisites --element-id <deprecated_element_id>

# 3. Review monitoring data
pnpm db:review-monitoring --element-id <deprecated_element_id> --days 30
```

**Assessment Criteria:**

- Zero access events in monitoring period
- No performance impact from retaining element
- No undocumented dependencies found
- Stakeholder confirmation of business impact

### Step 2: Create Removal Plan

```bash
# Generate comprehensive removal plan
pnpm db:create-removal-plan --elements <element_list> --include-dependencies
```

**Removal Plan Contents:**

- Detailed execution steps
- Dependency removal order
- Validation checkpoints
- Rollback procedures (limited)
- Risk assessment
- Timeline and duration estimates

### Step 3: Final Safety Validation

```bash
# Execute final safety checks
pnpm db:final-safety-check --removal-plan-id <plan_id>
```

**Final Safety Checks:**

- Re-verify zero usage
- Confirm no new dependencies
- Validate backup integrity
- Test emergency procedures
- Verify approval documentation

### Step 4: Create Final Backup

```bash
# Create comprehensive pre-removal backup
pnpm db:create-final-backup --removal-plan-id <plan_id> --verification-level comprehensive
```

**Backup Requirements:**

- Full database backup
- Element-specific backup
- Metadata and schema backup
- Test restoration verification
- Multiple backup locations

### Step 5: Execute Removal (Point of No Return)

> **üö® CRITICAL**: This step is irreversible. All previous steps must be completed and verified.

```bash
# Execute removal plan with final confirmation
pnpm db:execute-removal --plan-id <plan_id> --confirm-irreversible --require-approval
```

**Execution Process:**

1. Final confirmation prompts
2. Approval verification
3. Transaction-based removal
4. Step-by-step validation
5. Real-time monitoring
6. Immediate verification

### Step 6: Post-Removal Validation

```bash
# Validate removal completion
pnpm db:validate-removal --plan-id <plan_id>
```

**Post-Removal Checks:**

- Confirm elements are completely removed
- Verify no broken dependencies
- Test application functionality
- Monitor for errors
- Document completion

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Multi-Stage Approval

**Required Approvals:**

- **Technical Lead**: Database impact assessment
- **Application Owner**: Business impact confirmation
- **Operations Manager**: Infrastructure impact approval
- **Security Officer**: Security impact review (if applicable)

**Approval Documentation:**

- Formal approval tickets
- Risk assessment acknowledgment
- Business impact statements
- Technical review summaries

### 2. Verification Requirements

**Pre-Removal Verification:**

```sql
-- Verify element exists in deprecated state
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name LIKE '%_deprecated_%';

-- Confirm zero current usage
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM monitoring.access_events
WHERE element_name = '<deprecated_element>'
AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Validate dependencies
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE table_name = '<deprecated_element>';
```

**Post-Removal Verification:**

```sql
-- Confirm element is completely removed
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name = '<original_element_name>';

-- Verify no broken references
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_name LIKE '%<element_name>%';

-- Check for application errors
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM application_logs
WHERE level = 'ERROR'
AND timestamp > '<removal_timestamp>';
```

### 3. Emergency Procedures

**If Issues Are Detected:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Stop any ongoing removal operations
   - Assess impact scope
   - Engage incident response team
   - Document all findings

2. **Recovery Options:**
   - Restore from final backup (if possible)
   - Recreate elements manually
   - Implement temporary workarounds
   - Rollback to previous migration state

3. **Communication:**
   - Notify all stakeholders immediately
   - Provide regular status updates
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update procedures based on findings
