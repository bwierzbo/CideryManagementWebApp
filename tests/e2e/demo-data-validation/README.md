# Demo Data Validation System - Issue #9

This comprehensive demo data validation system ensures ≥95% of seeded demo data is visible through the UI and validates data accuracy across the entire cidery management workflow.

## Overview

The demo data validation system provides comprehensive validation of:

- **Data Visibility**: Verifies ≥95% of seeded demo data appears in the UI
- **Data Consistency**: Validates database-UI consistency across all entities
- **Entity Relationships**: Verifies referential integrity across the production workflow
- **Business Calculations**: Validates COGS, yields, measurements, and ABV calculations
- **Data Completeness**: Checks for missing data and assesses data quality
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tests data-heavy page load times
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed HTML, JSON, and CSV reports

## Quick Start

### Running the Complete Validation Suite

```bash
# Run the comprehensive demo data validation
npx playwright test tests/e2e/demo-data-validation/final-integration-validation.test.ts

# Run individual validation components
npx playwright test tests/e2e/demo-data-validation/comprehensive-data-validation.test.ts
```

### Running Specific Validation Types

```bash
# Data visibility only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/demo-data-validation/ --grep "≥95% Demo Data Visibility"

# Business calculations only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/demo-data-validation/ --grep "Business Calculation Validation"

# Entity relationships only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/demo-data-validation/ --grep "Entity Relationship Verification"

# Performance monitoring only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/demo-data-validation/ --grep "Performance Monitoring"
```

## Architecture

### Core Validation Components

#### 1. DataValidator (`utils/data-validation.ts`)
- Validates data visibility across UI pages
- Checks database-UI consistency
- Performs entity-specific validation
- **Key Method**: `validateDemoData()`

#### 2. SeededDataDiscovery (`utils/seeded-data-discovery.ts`)
- Discovers all seeded data in the database
- Analyzes business workflow coverage
- Provides data inventory and completeness assessment
- **Key Method**: `discoverAllSeededData()`

#### 3. CalculationValidator (`utils/calculation-validators.ts`)
- Validates business calculations (COGS, yields, ABV, etc.)
- Checks UI calculation consistency
- Validates extraction rates and cost calculations
- **Key Method**: `validateAllCalculations()`

#### 4. RelationshipValidator (`utils/relationship-validators.ts`)
- Validates entity relationships and referential integrity
- Checks workflow continuity across the production chain
- Detects orphaned records and missing references
- **Key Method**: `validateAllRelationships()`

#### 5. DataCompletenessValidator (`utils/data-completeness-validator.ts`)
- Validates data freshness and completeness
- Performs data quality assessments
- Detects missing data and coverage gaps
- **Key Method**: `validateDataCompletenessAndFreshness()`

#### 6. ValidationReporter (`utils/validation-reporter.ts`)
- Generates comprehensive validation reports
- Exports to multiple formats (HTML, JSON, CSV)
- Provides CI/CD integration outputs
- **Key Method**: `generateComprehensiveReport()`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data Visibility < 95%**
   ```
   Issue: Some entities not visible in UI
   Check: Page selectors in data-validation.ts
   Fix: Update CSS selectors for entity detection
   ```

2. **Calculation Accuracy Failures**
   ```
   Issue: Business calculations don't match expected values
   Check: Calculation logic in calculation-validators.ts
   Fix: Verify calculation formulas and tolerances
   ```

3. **Relationship Integrity Issues**
   ```
   Issue: Orphaned records or missing references
   Check: Database seeding in packages/db/src/seed.ts
   Fix: Ensure proper foreign key relationships
   ```

4. **Performance Threshold Failures**
   ```
   Issue: Pages loading too slowly
   Check: Database query optimization
   Fix: Add indexes, optimize data fetching
   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
# Run with debug output
DEBUG=1 npx playwright test tests/e2e/demo-data-validation/

# Check specific validator
DEBUG=calculation-validator npx playwright test
```

### Manual Validation

Test individual components:

```typescript
// Manual data validator test
const dataValidator = new DataValidator(page);
const report = await dataValidator.validateDemoData();
console.log('Data Visibility:', report.summary.overallVisibilityPercentage);

// Manual calculation test
const calcValidator = new CalculationValidator(page);
const calcReport = await calcValidator.validateAllCalculations();
console.log('Calculation Accuracy:', calcReport.summary.averageAccuracy);
```

## Maintenance

### Updating Validation Rules

1. **Add New Entity Types**
   - Update `data-validation.ts` with new entity validation
   - Add selectors for UI detection
   - Include in seeded data discovery

2. **Add New Calculations**
   - Extend `calculation-validators.ts`
   - Add business logic validation
   - Include tolerance settings

3. **Update Performance Thresholds**
   - Modify thresholds in test files
   - Update page-specific requirements
   - Adjust for application changes

### Adding New Validations

```typescript
// Example: Add new entity validation
private async validateNewEntity(): Promise<void> {
  const dbRecords = await db.select().from(newEntityTable);
  // ... validation logic

  this.validationResults.push({
    entityType: 'new_entity',
    passed: /* validation result */,
    message: /* validation message */,
    // ... other properties
  });
}
```
